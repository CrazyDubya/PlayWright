## Setting Description

*The Crystal Chamber is the sacred heart of Rainbow Academy - a circular room with a domed ceiling that shows the sky above. In the center, a crystal pedestal rises from the floor, normally holding the Rainbow Crystal that protects the academy and surrounding kingdom.*

*The chamber is designed with beautiful stained glass windows showing the academy's history, and the walls are lined with smaller crystals that normally pulse with harmonious light. Everything about the space should feel sacred, peaceful, and magically protected.*

*But now the central pedestal is empty, and the smaller crystals flicker weakly. Shadows seem to creep in from the corners, and the magical warmth that usually fills the space has been replaced by an unsettling chill.*

## Scene Opening

*Dawn light filters through the chamber's dome as HEADMISTRESS AURORA enters for her daily check of the Crystal Chamber. She stops in shock when she sees the empty pedestal.*

AURORA
(whispered disbelief)
No... this isn't possible.

*She approaches the pedestal, her hands trembling as she reaches toward where the Rainbow Crystal should be floating.*

AURORA (CONT'D)
(calling out)
Emergency assembly! All students and staff to the main hall immediately!

*The scene shifts to the main hall as students and staff gather, confused and concerned. LUNA, RUBY, and SAGE enter together with their unicorn partners.*

RUBY
(to Luna and Sage)
I've never heard an emergency assembly called before. What do you think happened?

SAGE
(worried)
Something with the magical protections. I felt them fluctuate during the night - I thought it was just a minor adjustment.

LUNA
(observing)
Look at the portraits. They're not moving like they usually do.

*Indeed, the magical portraits that normally wave and interact with students are now still and watchful, as if conserving their energy.*

STARDUST
(nervously)
The magic feels... thin. Like something important is missing.

*AURORA enters the main hall, trying to maintain composure but clearly shaken.*

AURORA
(to the assembly)
Students and staff, I need to inform you of a serious situation. During the night, the Rainbow Crystal was removed from its chamber.

*Gasps and worried murmurs ripple through the crowd.*

STUDENT 1
(shocked)
Removed? But who could do that?

STUDENT 2
(frightened)
What does this mean for the academy's protection?

AURORA
(trying to stay calm)
The academy's basic protections remain in place, but they are... diminished. I want to assure everyone that we are investigating this matter thoroughly.

RUBY
(stepping forward)
Mother, how can we help? The Student Council is ready to assist in any way possible.

AURORA
(firmly)
Ruby, I appreciate your offer, but this is a matter for the faculty to handle. All students are to continue with their regular schedules while we resolve this situation.

*LUNA notices something the others have missed - the way the light falls differently in the hall, creating unusual shadow patterns.*

LUNA
(quietly to Sage)
Do you see how the shadows are moving? They're not following the normal light patterns.

SAGE
(looking where Luna points)
You're right. It's as if something is... watching.

*WHISPER approaches them, her ancient wisdom sensing the disturbance.*

WHISPER
(softly)
Little ones, be very careful today. When powerful magic is disturbed, it can attract things that should remain hidden.

BLAZE
(to the other unicorns)
We should stay close to our partners. Something about this feels deliberately planned.

*AURORA continues addressing the assembly, but her words reveal her own uncertainty.*

AURORA
(to everyone)
Classes will continue as normal, but no student is to enter the Crystal Chamber or attempt any independent investigation. This is for your own safety.

*The students begin to disperse, but Luna, Ruby, and Sage linger.*

LUNA
(to her friends)
Does anyone else think it's strange that there were no signs of forced entry? I mean, the Crystal Chamber has the strongest magical locks in the academy.

RUBY
(troubled)
You're right. And Mother seemed more worried than she was letting on.

SAGE
(thoughtfully)
I want to check something in the library. There might be historical precedents for this kind of theft.

*As they talk, the shadows in the hall seem to shift and listen.*

AURORA
(approaching them)
Girls, I meant what I said about not investigating. This could be dangerous.

LUNA
(respectfully but determined)
Headmistress Aurora, what if we just... paid attention? We wouldn't actively investigate, but if we noticed anything unusual...

AURORA
(torn between protection and trust)
Luna, I understand your desire to help, but you don't understand the forces that might be involved here.

RUBY
(to her mother)
But we're not children anymore. We're training to be leaders. Shouldn't we learn how to handle crises?

*AURORA looks at the three girls - her daughter, the new student with unusual abilities, and the brilliant researcher - and struggles with her decision.*

AURORA
(building to song)
You don't understand... when something like this happens, it means the very foundations of our safety are threatened. And I cannot... I will not... let anything happen to any of you.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "Something's Wrong"]*

## Musical Number: "Something's Wrong"

*The main hall transforms as the ensemble expresses their fear, confusion, and determination. The song builds from individual worry to collective resolve, with different characters reacting according to their personalities.*

### Verse 1 (Aurora, with growing concern)
```
Something's wrong, I can feel it
In the air, in the light
Something's wrong, and I fear
We're not safe here tonight

The protections that have kept us
All these years strong and true
Are failing, and I don't know
What we're going to do
```

### Chorus 1 (Students and Staff, building anxiety)
```
Something's wrong, something's wrong
We can feel it in our bones
Something's wrong, something's wrong
We're not safe here on our own

The magic that protected us
Is fading with the dawn
Something's wrong, something's wrong
And our safety's nearly gone
```

### Verse 2 (Luna, Ruby, Sage - determination emerging)
```
LUNA:
Something's wrong, but we're here

RUBY:
And we're stronger than we know

SAGE:
Something's wrong, but together

ALL THREE:
We can face what lies below

We're not helpless, we're not children
We have minds and hearts and will
If there's danger in the shadows
We won't just be standing still
```

### Bridge (Unicorns, sensing deeper magic)
```
STARDUST:
In the starlight, I can see it

BLAZE:
In the fire, I can feel

WHISPER:
In the memories, I know

ALL UNICORNS:
This threat is very real

But we're bonded to our partners
And our magic's strong and bright
We'll stand guard through the darkness
We'll protect them through the night
```

### Final Chorus (Full Company, building resolve)
```
ALL:
Something's wrong, something's wrong
But we're not alone in this
Something's wrong, something's wrong
But we won't just reminisce

AURORA:
I will keep you safe, I promise

STUDENTS:
We will help you if we can

ALL:
Something's wrong, but together
We will make our final stand

Something's wrong, something's wrong
But our courage will be strong
Something's wrong, something's wrong
But we'll right what has gone wrong
```

*[MUSIC ENDS with the ensemble in determined formation, ready to face whatever comes]*

## Scene Continuation

*As the music fades, the assembly begins to break up, but the three princesses and their unicorns remain together.*

AURORA
(to Luna, Ruby, and Sage)
I meant what I said. Please, just focus on your studies today. Let the faculty handle this.

*She exits, leaving the girls with their unicorns.*

RUBY
(frustrated)
I hate feeling helpless. There has to be something we can do.

SAGE
(practically)
Well, she didn't say we couldn't research historical cases of crystal theft. That's just... academic study.

LUNA
(with growing confidence)
And she didn't say we couldn't observe and take notes about anything unusual we might notice during our regular activities.

STARDUST
(to the other unicorns)
Should we tell them what we sensed during the night?

BLAZE
(decisively)
Yes. They need to know.

WHISPER
(gravely)
Last night, all the unicorns felt a presence in the academy. Something that shouldn't have been here.

LUNA
(alert)
What kind of presence?

STARDUST
(shivering)
Old magic. Angry magic. And... familiar somehow.

RUBY
(concerned)
Familiar how?

WHISPER
(with ancient memory)
Like something from the academy's past. Something that was here long ago.

*SAGE's eyes widen with understanding.*

SAGE
(excited)
That's it! I need to check the historical records. If this is connected to the academy's past, there might be clues in the old case files.

LUNA
(determined)
And I want to look at the Crystal Chamber. Not to investigate officially, just to... observe.

RUBY
(torn between rules and action)
But Mother said...

LUNA
(gently)
She said not to investigate. But we're students here. We have a right to understand what's happening to our home.

*RUBY considers this, her perfectionist nature warring with her desire to help.*

RUBY
(deciding)
You're right. We'll be careful, but we won't just sit here doing nothing.

*The three girls look at each other with new determination.*

SAGE
(to the group)
So we're really doing this? We're going to figure out what happened to the Rainbow Crystal?

LUNA
(with quiet confidence)
We're going to try. Together.

RUBY
(with new resolve)
Together.

*Their unicorn partners nuzzle them supportively.*

STARDUST
(softly)
Whatever's out there, it made a mistake coming to our academy.

BLAZE
(fiercely)
It doesn't know what we're capable of when we work together.

WHISPER
(wisely)
The greatest magic has always been the magic of friendship and courage.

*As the scene ends, the three princesses and their unicorns stand together in the main hall, no longer just individual students but a team ready to face whatever mystery awaits them.*

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The magical portraits on the walls seem to nod approvingly, and for just a moment, the academy's magic feels a little stronger.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
