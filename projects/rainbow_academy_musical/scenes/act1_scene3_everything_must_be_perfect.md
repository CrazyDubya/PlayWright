## Setting Description

*The academy practice grounds are an impressive outdoor space with multiple training areas. There are obstacle courses for unicorn-princess partnerships, diplomatic simulation spaces with floating platforms, magical practice circles with protective barriers, and performance stages for presentation skills.*

*Students move between different stations, practicing various princess skills. Everything is designed to showcase talent and achievement - scoreboards track progress, mirrors reflect perfect posture, and magical devices measure precision in spellcasting and movement.*

*The atmosphere is one of friendly competition and high standards, but underneath there's pressure to excel and be seen as worthy of the academy's reputation.*

## Scene Opening

*PRINCESS RUBY leads PRINCESS LUNA through the practice grounds, pointing out different training areas. BLAZE walks beside them with perfect posture, while STARDUST stays close to Luna, looking overwhelmed by all the activity.*

RUBY
(proudly)
These are our practice grounds, where we develop the skills every princess needs. Leadership, diplomacy, magical arts, physical coordination - everything that makes a well-rounded royal.

*She gestures to a group of students practicing formal presentations.*

RUBY (CONT'D)
Over there, the Leadership Track students are practicing state addresses. Perfect posture, clear diction, commanding presence - all essential skills.

LUNA
(watching nervously)
They look so... confident.

RUBY
(matter-of-factly)
Confidence comes from preparation and practice. When you know you've done everything perfectly, there's nothing to worry about.

*They move to another area where students are practicing magical arts with their unicorns.*

RUBY (CONT'D)
And here's magical coordination training. Each princess-unicorn pair works to achieve perfect synchronization. Watch this.

*She nods to BLAZE, and they perform a flawless routine - Ruby's gestures perfectly timed with Blaze's rainbow fire effects, creating beautiful patterns in the air.*

STUDENT 1
(applauding)
Beautiful work, Ruby! Your timing gets better every day.

RUBY
(pleased but not satisfied)
Thank you, but I noticed my third transition was a half-second slow. We'll need to practice that sequence again.

*LUNA watches this exchange with growing anxiety.*

LUNA
(to Stardust, quietly)
Did you see how perfect that was? I don't think I could ever...

STARDUST
(uncertainly)
Maybe we could try? I mean, we don't have to be perfect right away...

RUBY
(overhearing)
Oh, you should definitely try! Here, let me show you the basic coordination exercises.

*She demonstrates a simple routine, making it look effortless.*

RUBY (CONT'D)
It's really quite simple once you understand the principles. Perfect timing, precise movements, complete focus. Just follow my lead.

*LUNA attempts to copy Ruby's movements, but she's nervous and her gestures are hesitant. STARDUST tries to match with her starlight, but the timing is off.*

LUNA
(frustrated)
I'm sorry, I'm not... this is harder than it looks.

RUBY
(encouragingly but with high standards)
Don't worry! It just takes practice. Here, let me break it down step by step. First, your posture needs to be straighter. Shoulders back, chin up. Now, the gesture should be smooth and decisive, like this...

*She demonstrates again, and Luna tries to copy, but becomes more self-conscious with each correction.*

BLAZE
(to Stardust)
The key is confidence. You have to believe in your magic completely, or it won't respond properly.

STARDUST
(nervously)
But what if I make a mistake?

BLAZE
(matter-of-factly)
Then you practice until you don't make mistakes anymore. That's how you become excellent.

*Other students begin to gather, watching Luna's attempts. Their attention makes her even more nervous.*

STUDENT 2
(helpfully)
Maybe try holding your arm higher?

STUDENT 3
(also trying to help)
And remember to breathe steadily - magic responds to calm energy.

*The well-meaning advice only makes Luna feel more scrutinized and inadequate.*

LUNA
(increasingly flustered)
I... I think I need a break. This is a lot to take in.

RUBY
(concerned but not understanding)
Of course! I sometimes forget that not everyone has been training since childhood. Don't worry - with enough practice, you'll get there.

*She turns to address the other students, building to her song.*

RUBY (CONT'D)
(to the group)
You know, I think this is a good reminder for all of us about the standards we maintain here at Rainbow Academy. Excellence isn't just a goal - it's a responsibility.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "Everything Must Be Perfect"]*

## Musical Number: "Everything Must Be Perfect"

*The practice grounds transform into a showcase of academy excellence, with students demonstrating their skills in synchronized choreography. Ruby leads the number, showing both her genuine desire to help others excel and the pressure she feels to maintain impossible standards.*

### Verse 1 (Ruby)
```
Every gesture must be graceful
Every word must be just right
Every spell must be precisely cast
Every step must be in time

When you represent your kingdom
When you wear the royal crown
There's no room for almost perfect
You can never let them down
```

### Chorus (Ruby with Students joining)
```
Everything must be perfect
Every moment, every day
Everything must be perfect
That's the only royal way

No mistakes and no excuses
No second place will do
Everything must be perfect
When the world is watching you
```

### Verse 2 (Ruby, with more intensity)
```
I've been training since I could walk
Every lesson learned by heart
Mother says that excellence
Is where true leadership starts

When your family built this academy
When your name is on the wall
You don't get to be just good enough
You have to give your all
```

### Bridge (Ruby, showing the pressure she feels)
```
Sometimes I wonder what would happen
If I let my guard down for a day
If I made a single error
Would they take it all away?

But I can't afford to wonder
Can't afford to show I'm scared
When everyone expects perfection
I have to be prepared
```

### Final Chorus (Full ensemble, but Luna feeling increasingly isolated)
```
Everything must be perfect
Every moment, every day
Everything must be perfect
That's the only royal way

LUNA (sung underneath, growing distress):
What if perfect isn't possible?
What if I'm not meant to be
Everything that they expect here?
What if they can't see me?

ALL:
Everything must be perfect
When the world is watching you
```

*[MUSIC ENDS with students in perfect formation, except Luna who stands slightly apart, feeling overwhelmed]*

## Scene Continuation

*As the music fades, the students return to their practice activities, but the energy of perfectionism lingers. Luna sits on a bench, looking discouraged, while Stardust nuzzles her shoulder comfortingly.*

RUBY
(approaching, genuinely concerned)
Luna, are you alright? You look upset.

LUNA
(trying to hide her feelings)
I'm fine. Just... taking it all in.

RUBY
(sitting beside her)
I know it can seem overwhelming at first. When I started here, I felt the same way.

LUNA
(surprised)
You did? But you're so... perfect at everything.

RUBY
(with a hint of vulnerability)
That's because I've worked incredibly hard to be. My mother founded this academy, so I've always known I had to be the best example of what a Rainbow Academy student could be.

*She looks around at the other students practicing.*

RUBY (CONT'D)
Sometimes I think about what would happen if I wasn't perfect. If I disappointed everyone who believes in me.

LUNA
(understanding)
That sounds like a lot of pressure.

RUBY
(quickly covering)
But it's good pressure! It makes me better. And it can make you better too, if you're willing to work for it.

*STARDUST's horn glows softly, and Luna notices that some of the other students are struggling with their exercises too, but trying to hide it.*

LUNA
(thoughtfully)
Ruby, can I ask you something? Do you think there's only one way to be a good princess?

RUBY
(considering)
Well... there are different specialties, of course. But the fundamentals are the same - excellence, grace, leadership, serving your people with distinction.

LUNA
(carefully)
But what if someone's strengths are... different? What if they're good at things that don't look like traditional princess skills?

RUBY
(puzzled)
Like what?

LUNA
(hesitantly)
Like... noticing things others miss. Or asking questions that help solve problems. Or making people feel comfortable when they're scared.

*RUBY considers this, and for a moment, her perfect facade wavers.*

RUBY
(uncertainly)
I... I suppose those could be valuable. But they'd still need to be done excellently, right? With proper technique and training?

LUNA
(gently)
Maybe. Or maybe some things are valuable just because they come from the heart.

*BLAZE approaches, having overheard.*

BLAZE
(to Stardust)
Your starlight magic is quite unique. I've never seen anything quite like it.

STARDUST
(shyly)
It's not very impressive. It just... shows things that are already there.

BLAZE
(thoughtfully)
Sometimes the most powerful magic is the kind that reveals truth rather than creating spectacle.

*This comment makes both Ruby and Luna think.*

RUBY
(to Luna, with new curiosity)
What did Sage show you in the library today? You seemed excited when you came back.

LUNA
(brightening)
She taught me about detective work and investigation. Did you know the academy has solved dozens of mysteries over the years?

RUBY
(interested despite herself)
Really? I knew about the Research Track, but I never paid much attention to the detective specialization.

LUNA
(gaining confidence)
It's fascinating! It's all about observing carefully, asking the right questions, and seeing patterns that others miss. Sage says I have natural instincts for it.

*RUBY looks at Luna with new respect.*

RUBY
(genuinely)
That does sound valuable. I... I've always focused so much on the traditional skills that I never really explored the more specialized tracks.

LUNA
(warmly)
Maybe you could come to the library with us sometime? Sage would love to show you some of the cases they've solved.

RUBY
(considering)
I... I'd like that. As long as it doesn't interfere with my regular training schedule.

*The two girls smile at each other - a moment of genuine connection beyond the pressure of perfection.*

STARDUST
(to Blaze)
Would you like to practice together sometime? Not to be perfect, just to... explore what our magic can do together?

BLAZE
(surprised but pleased)
I'd like that. Maybe we could learn from each other.

*As the scene ends, there's a sense that relationships are beginning to form based on genuine interest rather than just academy expectations.*

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The practice grounds continue their activities, but now there's a subtle shift - some students are helping each other rather than just competing, and the atmosphere feels slightly less pressured and more collaborative.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
