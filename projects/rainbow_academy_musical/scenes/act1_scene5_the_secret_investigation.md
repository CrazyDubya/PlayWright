## Setting Description

*The scene moves fluidly between multiple academy locations as the investigation unfolds. The Crystal Chamber remains eerily empty, corridors seem longer and more shadowy than usual, and hidden passages behind tapestries and portraits are revealed for the first time.*

*The academy feels different during this investigation - more mysterious, with magic that responds to the girls' determination and curiosity. Secret doors open to their touch, and hidden details become visible when they work together.*

## Scene Opening

*The three princesses meet in an empty classroom, having skipped their regular afternoon classes. They spread out materials on a table - notebooks, magnifying glasses, and a rough map of the academy that Sage has drawn.*

SAGE
(organizing papers)
Alright, I've been thinking about this systematically. If we're going to investigate, we need to approach it like real detectives.

RUBY
(looking around nervously)
I still can't believe we're doing this. I've never skipped classes before.

LUNA
(reassuringly)
We're not skipping - we're conducting independent research. That's totally different.

SAGE
(grinning)
Exactly. Now, I've divided the investigation into three areas based on our different abilities.

*She points to her notes.*

SAGE (CONT'D)
Luna, your starlight magic can reveal hidden traces that normal investigation would miss. Ruby, your organizational skills and leadership training make you perfect for systematic evidence analysis. And I can research historical precedents and magical theory.

RUBY
(warming to the plan)
That actually makes sense. We each contribute what we're best at.

LUNA
(looking at the map)
Where should we start?

STARDUST
(softly)
The Crystal Chamber. If we're going to find traces of what happened, that's where they'll be strongest.

BLAZE
(practically)
But we need to be careful. If Headmistress Aurora finds us there...

WHISPER
(wisely)
Sometimes the greatest discoveries require the greatest courage.

*The girls exchange determined looks.*

RUBY
(taking charge)
Alright. We'll work in pairs to cover more ground. Luna and Stardust, you investigate the Crystal Chamber for magical traces. Sage and Whisper, you research historical cases. I'll coordinate and keep watch.

LUNA
(surprised)
You're not coming with us?

RUBY
(with new understanding)
I think... I think I need to learn that leadership sometimes means supporting others' strengths instead of trying to do everything myself.

*This moment of growth surprises everyone, including Ruby herself.*

SAGE
(pleased)
That's actually brilliant strategic thinking.

*They gather their materials and prepare to split up.*

LUNA
(to Ruby)
If you see anyone coming...

RUBY
(confidently)
I'll create a distraction. I'm very good at talking to authority figures.

*The scene shifts to the Crystal Chamber as Luna and Stardust enter cautiously.*

## Investigation Sequence 1: The Crystal Chamber

*LUNA and STARDUST approach the empty pedestal. The chamber feels cold and wrong without the Rainbow Crystal's presence.*

LUNA
(whispering)
Can you sense anything?

STARDUST
(horn beginning to glow)
There's something... let me try to make it visible.

*Stardust's starlight fills the chamber, and suddenly faint purple footprints become visible on the floor, leading from the pedestal to a wall.*

LUNA
(excited)
Stardust, you did it! Look - whoever took the crystal left magical traces.

*They follow the footprints to what appears to be a solid wall.*

STARDUST
(confused)
The trail just... stops here.

LUNA
(examining the wall)
Wait. This tapestry is hanging differently than the others.

*She pushes aside a tapestry to reveal a hidden passage.*

LUNA (CONT'D)
(amazed)
A secret passage! How many people know about this?

STARDUST
(nervously)
Probably not many. Which means whoever used it has been here before.

*Meanwhile, in the library, SAGE and WHISPER are researching.*

## Investigation Sequence 2: Historical Research

*SAGE has multiple books open, cross-referencing different historical accounts while WHISPER uses her memory magic to access older records.*

SAGE
(reading intently)
Here's something interesting. Fifteen years ago, right when the academy was founded, there was an incident involving a student who was... expelled.

WHISPER
(touching an old book with her horn)
I remember that time. There was great sadness and anger. A young prince who felt rejected and unwelcome.

SAGE
(taking notes)
The records are vague about what exactly happened, but it mentions "dangerous magical experimentation" and "threats to academy safety."

WHISPER
(with ancient sadness)
He was brilliant but troubled. The other students... they were not kind to him.

SAGE
(looking up)
Whisper, do you think this could be connected to the crystal theft?

WHISPER
(gravely)
Old wounds, when left unhealed, can fester into something much darker.

*Back in the corridor, RUBY keeps watch while coordinating the investigation.*

## Investigation Sequence 3: Coordination and Discovery

*RUBY moves between locations, checking on her friends and keeping track of their discoveries. She's using her leadership skills in a new way - supporting rather than directing.*

RUBY
(to herself, practicing)
If anyone asks, we're conducting a special research project on academy history and magical theory. Which is technically true.

*She checks her pocket watch.*

RUBY (CONT'D)
(worried)
They've been gone for twenty minutes. That's longer than we planned.

*LUNA and STARDUST emerge from the hidden passage, looking excited and concerned.*

LUNA
(to Ruby)
We found something incredible. There's a whole network of passages behind the walls, and they lead everywhere in the academy.

STARDUST
(adding)
And the magical traces are stronger in the passages. Whoever did this has been using them for a while.

*SAGE and WHISPER arrive with their research.*

SAGE
(breathlessly)
I found historical records about a student who was expelled fifteen years ago. The timing matches the academy's founding, and there were mentions of magical experiments and threats.

RUBY
(putting pieces together)
So we're looking for someone who knows the academy's secret passages, has a grudge against the institution, and has advanced magical abilities.

LUNA
(realizing)
And they've been planning this for a long time. This wasn't a random theft.

*The four friends and their unicorns gather in a circle, sharing their discoveries.*

WHISPER
(with growing concern)
There's something else. The magical signature I sensed... it's familiar because it's connected to the academy's founding. This person was here when the academy began.

BLAZE
(understanding)
Which means they know all our defenses and how to get around them.

STARDUST
(worried)
And they're still here somewhere, hiding in the passages.

*The girls look at each other with a mixture of excitement and fear.*

RUBY
(taking charge)
We need to tell Headmistress Aurora what we've found.

LUNA
(hesitating)
But we disobeyed her direct orders. She'll be furious.

SAGE
(practically)
She'll be more furious if something worse happens and we could have prevented it.

*As they debate, the shadows in the corridor seem to shift and listen.*

RUBY
(building to song)
You know what? I don't care if we get in trouble. We're not just students anymore - we're detectives. And detectives don't give up when things get difficult.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "We Can Figure This Out"]*

## Musical Number: "We Can Figure This Out"

*The various academy locations blend together as the girls sing about their growing confidence and teamwork. The staging shows them working together, with each character's abilities complementing the others.*

### Verse 1 (Luna, with growing confidence)
```
I never thought I'd be the one
To lead an investigation
But when I see what others miss
It fills me with elation

My starlight shows the hidden truth
That lies beneath the surface
And with my friends beside me here
I know we'll find our purpose
```

### Verse 2 (Ruby, discovering new leadership)
```
I used to think that being perfect
Meant doing everything alone
But now I see that real strength comes
From seeds that we have sown

Together we're much stronger than
We ever were apart
When everyone contributes their gift
We're following our heart
```

### Verse 3 (Sage, applying knowledge practically)
```
All the books I've ever read
Are coming alive today
When knowledge meets with courage
We can find another way

The past can teach the present
If we're willing to explore
And mysteries that seemed impossible
Don't seem so hard anymore
```

### Chorus (All three, with unicorns joining)
```
We can figure this out
We can solve this mystery
We can figure this out
When we work together, we're free

Every clue that we discover
Every piece that fits in place
Shows us that we're stronger
When we're working face to face

We can figure this out
We can figure this out
Together, we can figure this out
```

### Bridge (Unicorns, with magical harmonies)
```
STARDUST:
In the starlight, truth appears

BLAZE:
In the fire, courage grows

WHISPER:
In the memory, wisdom flows

ALL UNICORNS:
And together, our magic shows

That friendship is the strongest spell
That love can conquer fear
When hearts and minds work as one
The answer becomes clear
```

### Final Chorus (Full group, with building excitement)
```
ALL:
We can figure this out
We can solve this mystery
We can figure this out
When we work together, we're free

Every friendship that we're building
Every trust that we create
Shows us that together
We can change our academy's fate

We can figure this out
We can figure this out
Together, we can figure this out

(Building to climax)
No mystery's too big for us
No challenge we can't face
When we combine our different gifts
We'll solve this case!
```

*[MUSIC ENDS with the girls and unicorns in a confident formation, ready to continue their investigation]*

## Scene Continuation

*As the music fades, the girls are energized and determined, but also aware of the growing seriousness of their situation.*

LUNA
(with new confidence)
We really can do this. We each bring something important to the investigation.

RUBY
(with genuine warmth)
I never realized how much I could learn from working with others instead of trying to be perfect on my own.

SAGE
(excited)
And we've already discovered more in one afternoon than the faculty has found since this morning.

*STARDUST's horn suddenly glows brighter.*

STARDUST
(alerting)
Someone's coming. I can sense their magical signature.

BLAZE
(ready for action)
Should we hide?

WHISPER
(calmly)
No. It's time to be brave and share what we've learned.

*HEADMISTRESS AURORA appears in the corridor, looking stern but also worried.*

AURORA
(firmly)
Girls, I specifically told you not to investigate this matter.

RUBY
(stepping forward)
Mother, we found something important. We think we know who took the crystal.

AURORA
(surprised despite her anger)
What do you mean?

LUNA
(respectfully but confidently)
Headmistress Aurora, we found evidence that the thief has been using secret passages in the academy walls. They left magical traces that only starlight magic could reveal.

SAGE
(adding)
And the historical records suggest this might be connected to a student who was expelled when the academy was founded.

*AURORA's expression shifts from anger to concern.*

AURORA
(quietly)
Show me what you found.

*The girls exchange glances - they've crossed a line, but they're committed now.*

LUNA
(determined)
Follow us.

*As they lead Aurora toward their discoveries, the shadows in the corridor seem to retreat, as if whatever has been watching doesn't want to be discovered by the headmistress.*

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The investigation has moved from secret student activity to official academy business, raising the stakes for everyone involved.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
