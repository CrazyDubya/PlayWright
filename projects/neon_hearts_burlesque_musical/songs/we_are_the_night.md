## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - STELLA (Sewing, maternal)**

**STELLA** (Yiddish folk melody, warm and protective):
*Needle and thread, beads and lace*
*I sew dreams for every face*
*That walks through this velvet door*
*Looking for something more*
*Than the world outside can give*
*Here's where broken hearts can live*

*Twenty years I've watched them grow*
*From scared girls to women who know*
*Their worth, their power, their light*
*We are the guardians of the night*

### **VERSE 2 - MAX (Overlapping, Irish strength)**

**MAX** (Irish folk rhythm, tough but caring):
*Count the till, check the books*
*Ignore the customers' dirty looks*
*When they think we're just a show*
*They don't see what we really know*
*About survival, about grace*
*About finding your rightful place*

*When the world says you're too much*
*Too loud, too proud, too rough*
*We say come in, take the stage*
*Turn your pain into your rage*
*Into beauty, into art*
*We are the keepers of the heart*

### **CHORUS 1 - BUILDING ENSEMBLE**

**STELLA & MAX** (Harmony building):
*We are the night*
*When the day won't have you*
*We are the light*
*When the darkness finds you*
*We are the family*
*You choose for yourself*
*When blood ain't enough*
*And you need something else*

### **VERSE 3 - TOMMY (Unexpected tenderness)**

**TOMMY** (Sicilian melody, protective):
*These hands have done terrible things*
*But here they protect angel wings*
*Made of feathers and sequined dreams*
*Nothing's quite what it seems*
*In this velvet sanctuary*
*Where the broken come to be*

*Free from judgment, free from shame*
*Free to make their own damn name*
*I stand guard at the door*
*'Cause I know what we're fighting for*
*Not just a building, not just a job*
*But a place where hearts don't sob*
*Alone*

### **VERSE 4 - RUBY (Building intensity)**

**RUBY** (Italian-American passion):
*Fifteen years ago I walked in*
*Pregnant, scared, thick and thin*
*Was all I had to my name*
*Playing someone else's game*
*But Stella taught me how to sew*
*Max taught me how to grow*
*Strong*

*Tommy kept the wolves away*
*While I learned how to stay*
*Standing when the world said fall*
*This place caught me through it all*
*Now it's my turn to fight*
*We are the children of the night*

### **BRIDGE - CANDY (Conflicted, guilty)**

**CANDY** (Polish folk melody, torn):
*I came here just a girl*
*From a cold and distant world*
*Where dreams were just for rich folks*
*And hope was just for jokes*
*But you took me in*
*Taught me how to win*
*At this game of lights and shadows*

*Now I stand here torn between*
*What I want and what I've seen*
*Of loyalty and love and loss*
*Every choice has got a cost*
*But tonight, right here, right now*
*I remember how*
*You saved me*

### **FINAL CHORUS - FULL COMPANY**

**ALL** (Powerful, building to climax):
*We are the night*
*When the day won't have you*
*We are the light*
*When the darkness finds you*
*We are the family*
*You choose for yourself*
*When blood ain't enough*
*And you need something else*

**RUBY** (Over the ensemble):
*We are the misfits and the dreamers*

**STELLA** (Overlapping):
*We are the mothers and the daughters*

**MAX** (Adding harmony):
*We are the fighters and believers*

**TOMMY** (Bass line):
*We are the guardians of these waters*

**CANDY** (Conflicted counterpoint):
*We are the ones who might betray*
*But love you anyway*

**ALL** (Final explosion):
*We are the night*
*We are the light*
*We are the family*
*That won't let go*
*Without a fight*

*We are the velvet room*
*We are the neon heart*
*We are the ones*
*Who won't depart*
*From each other*
*From this place*
*From the love*
*That time can't erase*

*WE ARE THE NIGHT!*

### **OUTRO - QUIET RESOLUTION**

**ALL** (Soft, intimate):
*And when the morning comes*
*And the neon fades away*
*We'll still be here*
*We'll still be family*
*Come what may*

*(Music fades as they continue their preparations, the bonds between them visible and strong)*
