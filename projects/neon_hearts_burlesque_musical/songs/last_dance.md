## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - RUBY (Leading, bittersweet)**

**RUBY** (In Stella's final costume, radiant but heartbroken):
*Ladies and gentlemen*
*Welcome to our last dance*
*Fifteen years of dreams*
*Come down to this final chance*
*To show you what we are*
*What we've always been*
*Not just bodies in the spotlight*
*But souls that refuse to dim*

*So we'll dance like it's forever*
*We'll sing like it's the first time*
*We'll love like there's no tomorrow*
*'Cause tomorrow's not so kind*
*To dreamers and believers*
*To misfits and the lost*
*But tonight we're still together*
*Whatever tomorrow costs*

### **VERSE 2 - CANDY (Guilty but present)**

**CANDY** (In her new Flamingo costume, but her heart is here):
*I made my choice*
*I took the deal*
*I chose the future*
*Over what I feel*
*For this family*
*For this place*
*But I couldn't leave*
*Without seeing*
*Each beloved face*

*One more time*
*In the neon light*
*One more dance*
*Before I take flight*
*To bigger stages*
*Brighter dreams*
*But nothing*
*Will ever be*
*What this seems*
*Like home*

### **CHORUS 1 - BUILDING ENSEMBLE**

**COMPANY** (Voices layering, bittersweet harmony):
*This is our last dance*
*In the velvet room*
*This is our last chance*
*To chase away the gloom*
*With sequins and with laughter*
*With music and with light*
*We are the children*
*Of the neon night*

*And though they tear*
*These walls down*
*Though they scatter*
*Us around*
*We'll carry*
*This moment*
*In our hearts*
*Where it can't*
*Be torn apart*

### **VERSE 3 - STELLA (Watching her children perform)**

**STELLA** (From the wings, maternal pride):
*Look at them*
*My beautiful girls*
*My broken boys*
*Who learned to shine*
*Like precious pearls*
*In the darkness*
*Of this world*
*That tried*
*To break them*

*Every costume*
*I ever made*
*Every dream*
*I helped create*
*Lives on*
*In how they move*
*How they stand*
*How they prove*
*That beauty*
*Survives*
*Everything*

### **VERSE 4 - MAX (Cynical but moved)**

**MAX** (Counting the till one last time):
*Twenty years*
*I've run this place*
*Twenty years*
*Of saving face*
*For girls*
*Who needed*
*Somewhere safe*
*To be*
*Themselves*

*I told myself*
*It was just business*
*Just a job*
*Just paying rent*
*But watching them*
*Tonight*
*I know*
*What all those years*
*Really meant*
*Family*

### **BRIDGE - TOMMY (Unexpected poetry)**

**TOMMY** (From his post by the door):
*I've stood guard*
*At this door*
*For fifteen years*
*Keeping out*
*The wolves*
*The fears*
*The men*
*Who'd hurt*
*My girls*

*These hands*
*That once*
*Destroyed*
*Learned how*
*To protect*
*What matters*
*And what matters*
*Isn't bricks*
*And mortar*
*It's the love*
*We built*
*Inside*

### **FINAL CHORUS - EXPLOSIVE CELEBRATION**

**ALL** (Full voice, triumphant despite the sadness):
*This is our last dance*
*But not our last song*
*This is our last chance*
*To prove they're wrong*
*Who say we're just*
*Entertainment*
*Just bodies*
*Just a show*

*We are artists*
*We are family*
*We are more*
*Than they will ever know*
*We are the keepers*
*Of the flame*
*That burns*
*In every heart*
*That refuses*
*To be tamed*

**RUBY** (Over the ensemble):
*We are the velvet room!*

**STELLA** (Overlapping):
*We are the neon hearts!*

**MAX** (Adding harmony):
*We are the midnight dreams!*

**TOMMY** (Bass line):
*We are the family*
*That never parts!*

**CANDY** (Conflicted counterpoint):
*Even when we leave*
*We never really go*

**ALL** (Final explosion):
*This is our last dance*
*In this sacred space*
*But the dance goes on*
*In every heart*
*In every place*
*Where dreamers gather*
*Where misfits find*
*Their home*

*We are the last dance*
*We are the final song*
*We are the proof*
*That love*
*Lives on*
*LIVES ON!*

### **OUTRO - THE GOODBYE**

**RUBY** (As the music fades, speaking to the audience):
*Thank you*
*For fifteen years*
*Of letting us*
*Into your hearts*
*For seeing us*
*As more than*
*What we seemed*

*(Singing softly)*
*The velvet room*
*May close tonight*
*But the neon hearts*
*Will always*
*Burn bright*
*Somewhere*
*In the darkness*
*Lighting the way*
*For the next*
*Generation*
*Of dreamers*

*(The company takes their final bow as confetti falls like snow)*
