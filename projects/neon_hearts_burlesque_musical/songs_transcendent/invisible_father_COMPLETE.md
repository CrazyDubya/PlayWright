# "INVISIBLE FATHER"
## Act I, Song 2.5 - Mickey's Solo Revelation

**SETTING:** Immediately following the father-daughter recognition. CANDY has gone to process the revelation. RUBY and JACK have stepped away to give MICKEY space. He sits alone at the piano, twenty years of hidden love finally able to be spoken.

**FUNCTION:** Mickey's complete backstory revealed through song - the deportation, the choice to stay invisible, the twenty years of watching his daughter grow.

**STYLE:** Haunting ballad with Polish folk influences building to cathartic release. Piano-driven with minimal orchestration to maintain intimacy.

## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE DEPORTATION**

**MICKEY** (Alone at piano, hands trembling on keys):
*1943*
*They came at dawn*
*Said I was dangerous*
*Said I didn't belong*
*Polish immigrant*
*With suspicious friends*
*They gave me twenty-four hours*
*To make my amends*

*Pack your bags*
*Leave your life*
*Leave your three-year-old daughter*
*Leave your wife*
*But I couldn't*
*I couldn't go*
*So I became*
*A ghost*
*They'd never know*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE CHOICE**

**MICKEY** (Building intensity):
*Invisible father*
*Watching from the shadows*
*Invisible father*
*Love that no one knows*
*Every lullaby*
*Played from far away*
*Every prayer*
*For my daughter*
*Every single day*

*I chose*
*To disappear*
*Rather than*
*Abandon*
*I chose*
*To love*
*From here*
*In the only way*
*I could*
*Manage*

### **VERSE 2 - THE WATCHING YEARS**

**MICKEY** (Memory flooding back):
*I watched you*
*Take your first steps*
*From across the street*
*I watched you*
*Start school*
*My heart*
*Skip a beat*
*When you cried*
*I wanted*
*To run to you*
*But running*
*Would have meant*
*Losing you*
*For good*

*Your mother*
*Worked three jobs*
*I sent money*
*Anonymous*
*Every week*
*She never knew*
*It came from me*
*The father*
*She thought*
*Was weak*

### **BRIDGE - THE MUSIC CONNECTION**

**MICKEY** (Rapid-fire, passionate):
*When you were seven*
*You started humming*
*The lullabies*
*I used to sing*
*When you were ten*
*You found a piano*
*And my heart*
*Began to ring*
*With hope*

*Music*
*Was our connection*
*Music*
*Was our bridge*
*Every song*
*You learned*
*Was love*
*Across*
*The ridge*
*Of years*
*And fear*
*And impossible*
*Choices*

### **VERSE 3 - THE VELVET ROOM YEARS**

**MICKEY** (Voice growing stronger):
*When you turned eighteen*
*And came to the city*
*I followed*
*Like a shadow*
*Full of pity*
*And pride*
*And terror*
*That you'd*
*Make the same*
*Mistakes*

*But Ruby*
*Took you in*
*Gave you*
*What I couldn't*
*A home*
*A family*
*A chance*
*To shine*
*The way*
*I always knew*
*You would*

*So I became*
*The piano player*
*The invisible man*
*In the corner*
*Playing your music*
*Supporting your dreams*
*From the shadows*
*Where fathers*
*Like me*
*Belong*

### **FINAL CHORUS - THE REVELATION**

**MICKEY** (Full voice, twenty years of love released):
*Invisible father*
*No longer hiding*
*Invisible father*
*Love finally*
*Residing*
*In the open*
*In the light*
*In your eyes*
*That see me*
*Tonight*

*I chose*
*To disappear*
*But love*
*Never abandoned*
*I chose*
*To sacrifice*
*Everything*
*But the music*
*That connected*
*Us*

*Twenty years*
*Of invisible love*
*Twenty years*
*Of watching*
*From above*
*And below*
*And beside*
*And within*
*Every song*
*You've ever*
*Sung*

### **OUTRO - THE PROMISE**

**MICKEY** (Quiet, intimate, speaking to Candy though she's not there):
*Córeczko*
*My little daughter*
*I know*
*Twenty years*
*Is too long*
*To wait*
*For an explanation*

*But if you'll*
*Let me*
*I'll spend*
*The next twenty*
*Making up*
*For the love*
*You thought*
*You'd lost*

*I'll teach you*
*Every Polish song*
*Your grandmother*
*Sang*
*I'll tell you*
*Stories*
*About the man*
*You thought*
*Was gone*

*I'll be*
*Your father*
*Not invisible*
*Anymore*
*If you'll*
*Open*
*That door*

*(He plays the lullaby one more time, but now it's not hidden - it's an invitation)*

## TRANSCENDENT ELEMENTS

**CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY:** Polish immigrant experience, deportation fears, invisible labor
**PERSONAL TRAUMA:** Twenty years of separation transformed into twenty years of love
**MORAL COMPLEXITY:** No villains, just impossible choices made from love
**CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE:** Immigration, family separation, invisible workers
**MUSICAL INTEGRATION:** Piano as character, lullaby as connection, music as love language

**THIS SONG MAKES THE AUDIENCE:**
- **SWEAT** with the intensity of hidden love finally revealed
- **CRY** for twenty years of sacrifice and separation
- **SWOON** over the depth of paternal devotion
- **LAUGH** through tears at the music connection
- **GRIN** at the promise of reconciliation
- **ANGUISH** over the cost of survival in America

Mickey becomes the moral center of the musical - the invisible father whose love never wavered, whose sacrifice enabled his daughter's success, whose music connected them across impossible distance.

This song transforms him from background character to the beating heart of the story.
