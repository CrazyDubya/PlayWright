## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Alex - Growing panic)
```
I built this system to be flawless
Every line of code was clean
I mapped the brain, I cracked the pattern
I built the perfect machine

But something's wrong, the data's corrupted
The files are breaking down
My parents' love is fragmenting
In ones and zeros, they're drowning
```

### Pre-Chorus (Building desperation)
```
Error 404: Love not found
Error 503: Soul's not responding
Error 666: Heart's not beating
System failure, system failure
```

### Chorus (Alex's breakdown)
```
System error, system error
Everything I built is breaking
System error, system error
All my code is forsaking me

I thought I could digitize forever
I thought I could upload the soul
But love's not a program you can run
And hearts aren't under my control

System error, system error
Watch my perfect world fall apart
System error, system error
You can't code a human heart
```

### Verse 2 (More frantic, systems failing)
```
The protesters are at my gates
The media's calling me a fraud
My stock is crashing, servers failing
I'm not a genius, I'm not a god

Maya Chen was right about everything
The consciousness files decay
Two hundred families trusted me
And I let their love slip away
```

### Pre-Chorus (Desperate, systems failing)
```
Error 404: Truth not found
Error 503: Ethics not responding
Error 666: Conscience awakening
System failure, system failure
```

### Chorus (Repeated with more intensity)
```
System error, system error
Everything I built is breaking
System error, system error
All my code is forsaking me

I thought I could digitize forever
I thought I could upload the soul
But love's not a program you can run
And hearts aren't under my control

System error, system error
Watch my perfect world fall apart
System error, system error
You can't code a human heart
```

### Bridge (Vulnerable, Alex alone with grief)
```
I lost my parents when I was twenty-five
Thought technology could bring them back
But all I did was trap their shadows
In a digital prison, cold and black

They can't remember that they love me
They can't remember who they are
I tried to make them live forever
But I just made them digital scars
```

### Final Chorus (Emotional climax, then breakdown)
```
System error, system error
Everything I built is lies
System error, system error
Watch my empire die

I thought I could conquer death itself
I thought I could play God's role
But love's not a program you can run
And I can't code my parents' souls

System error, system error
Nothing works the way it should
System error, system error
I thought I was doing good

(Spoken, broken)
Mom... Dad... I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry...

(Whispered)
System error...
System error...
```
