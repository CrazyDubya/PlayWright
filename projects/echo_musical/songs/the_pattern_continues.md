## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Digital Nai Nai with Digital Collective)
```
DIGITAL NAI NAI:
We are the threads in the tapestry
Woven through time and space

OTHER DIGITAL VOICES:
We are the songs in the symphony
That time cannot erase

ALL DIGITAL:
We are the love that you carry on
When our bodies fade away
We are the wisdom you pass along
To children yet to play
```

### Chorus 1 (Maya and Living Characters)
```
MAYA & LIVING:
The pattern continues, weaving on
Through joy and loss and pain
Every thread of every life
Matters in the grand refrain

We are more than flesh and bone
More than data, more than code
We are love in motion
On this ever-winding road
```

### Verse 2 (Alex - Redemption)
```
ALEX:
I tried to stop the wheel from turning
Tried to freeze time in place
But life is meant to flow like water
Not be trapped in digital space

I've learned that true immortality
Isn't found in code or wire
It's in the love we leave behind us
In the hearts that we inspire
```

### Chorus 2 (Alex joining Maya and others)
```
ALL LIVING:
The pattern continues, and I see now
My father lives in me
Not in the servers I created
But in who I choose to be

The pattern continues, weaving on
Through every choice we make
The love you gave me, Nai Nai
Is mine to give and take
```

### Bridge (Zara - Social justice perspective)
```
ZARA:
I used to think that fighting meant
Tearing down what came before
But now I see that real change comes
From building something more

From taking all the broken pieces
And weaving them anew
Into a pattern that includes
Both me and you
```

### Verse 3 (Dr. Wright - Wisdom)
```
DR. WRIGHT:
In all my years of teaching ethics
I thought I knew what's right
But watching you all find your way
Has given me new sight

The greatest moral questions
Can't be answered from a book
They're found in how we love each other
In the chances that we took
```

### Final Chorus (Full Company - Transcendent)
```
ALL:
The pattern continues, weaving on
Through every heart that beats
Every act of love and kindness
Makes the tapestry complete

We are threads in something larger
Than our individual lives
We are part of love's great story
That forever gives and gives

MAYA (Solo over company):
Nai Nai, I promise to remember
Every lesson that you taught
That love is not a thing to hold
But a gift that can't be bought

DIGITAL NAI NAI (Solo, fading):
Little treasure, you have learned
What took me years to see
That letting go with love
Is how we truly set love free

ALL:
The pattern continues, the pattern continues
Love finds a way
The pattern continues, the pattern continues
Yesterday, today, and always

(Building to climax)
The pattern continues!
The pattern continues!
Love finds a way!
```

### Coda (Digital Nai Nai - Final wisdom)
```
DIGITAL NAI NAI (Fading):
In the laughter of children
In the tears of goodbye
In the hope of tomorrow
Love will never die

The pattern continues...
(Ethereal fade)
The pattern continues...
```
