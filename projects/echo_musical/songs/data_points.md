## Song Structure

### Verse 1
*[Maya at her lab computer, analyzing brain scans]*

Every thought's a neural pathway
Every feeling's just a spark
Synapses firing in sequence
Nothing mystical or dark

Consciousness is computation
Memories are stored as code
Love's just oxytocin flooding
Down a well-established road

### Pre-Chorus
*[Building intensity as she pulls up more data]*

Show me evidence, show me proof
Show me something I can measure
Not your stories, not your truth
Just the data I can treasure

### Chorus
*[Full orchestration, Maya's scientific manifesto]*

Give me data points, not fairy tales
Numbers that will never fail
Every mystery has an answer
If you know where to look
Every question has a solution
Written in some textbook

Data points, that's all we are
Firing neurons, nothing more
Don't tell me about the soul
When the brain explains it all

### Verse 2
*[Moving through lab, examining equipment]*

Consciousness uploading? Please.
You can't digitize a dream
Copy neural architecture
But you'll never catch the stream

Of what makes us truly human
It's biology, not code
When the body stops its functions
That's the end of the road

### Pre-Chorus
*[More insistent, defensive]*

Show me evidence, show me proof
Show me something I can measure
Not your hopes, not your truth
Just the data I can treasure

### Chorus
*[Repeated with variations]*

Give me data points, not fairy tales
Numbers that will never fail
Every mystery has an answer
If you know where to look
Every question has a solution
Written in some textbook

Data points, that's all we are
Firing neurons, nothing more
Don't tell me about the soul
When the brain explains it all

### Bridge
*[Quieter, more vulnerable - Maya touches her grandmother's jade bracelet]*

Sometimes in the quiet moments
When the lab is still and dark
I wonder if there's something more
Than just this beating heart

But then I see the brain scans
And the patterns make it clear
We're just biological machines
With nothing left to fear

### Final Chorus
*[Building to powerful finish, but with hint of uncertainty]*

Give me data points, not fairy tales
Numbers that will never fail
Every mystery has an answer
(But what if I'm wrong?)
Every question has a solution
(What if love is strong?)

Data points, that's all we are
Firing neurons, nothing more
Don't tell me about the soul...
(When the brain can't explain it all)

### Outro
*[Spoken, as she receives the mysterious data files]*

"What the hell is this?"

## Lyrical Analysis

### Character Voice
- Scientific vocabulary mixed with emotional undertones
- Defensive tone suggesting she's trying to convince herself
- Repetitive structure mirrors obsessive scientific thinking
- Parenthetical doubts show cracks in her certainty

### Rhyme Scheme
- Primarily ABAB in verses
- AABB in chorus for stronger, more declarative feel
- Internal rhymes in bridge for complexity
- Slant rhymes ("proof/truth") show imperfection in her logic

### Musical Integration
- Electronic beats under orchestral base reflect her tech world
- Melody becomes more complex in bridge, showing inner conflict
- Key change in final chorus suggests transformation beginning
- Sudden stop for spoken outro creates dramatic transition

## Staging Concepts

### Set Elements
- Maya's high-tech laboratory with multiple screens
- Brain scan projections on backdrop
- Computer workstation center stage
- Scientific equipment that lights up with music

### Movement
- Precise, controlled gestures matching scientific precision
- Interaction with lab equipment as choreographic elements
- Gradual movement from confined lab space to center stage
- Touch of jade bracelet as vulnerable moment

### Lighting
- Cool blue/white laboratory lighting
- Screens and equipment provide additional light sources
- Warmer light during bridge section (vulnerability)
- Sudden change to mysterious lighting for outro

### Props
- Computer tablets and screens
- Brain scan printouts
- Scientific equipment
- Jade bracelet (key emotional prop)

## Vocal Requirements

### Range
- Comfortable mezzo-soprano range (A3-F5)
- Strong middle register for verses
- Belt capability for chorus climaxes
- Controlled dynamics for bridge vulnerability

### Style
- Contemporary musical theater with pop influences
- Precise diction for scientific terminology
- Emotional subtext beneath analytical delivery
- Ability to convey both confidence and doubt

## Orchestration Notes

### Instrumentation
- Electronic keyboard/synthesizer base
- Traditional orchestra overlay
- Percussion emphasizing rhythmic precision
- Strings for emotional undertones in bridge

### Musical Themes
- "Data Points" motif (repeated rhythmic pattern)
- "Uncertainty" theme (minor key variations)
- "Technology" sound (electronic elements)
- "Heritage" hint (subtle traditional Chinese instrument in bridge)

## Character Arc Integration

### What This Song Establishes
- Maya's scientific worldview and expertise
- Her defensive attitude about consciousness
- Hidden emotional vulnerability
- Connection to grandmother (jade bracelet)
- Setup for her journey toward accepting mystery

### How It Connects to Later Songs
- "The Upload" will transform this scientific certainty
- "Beyond the Code" will directly contradict these lyrics
- "Data Points" melody returns in finale, transformed
- Bridge melody becomes "heritage" theme throughout show

## Revision Notes
