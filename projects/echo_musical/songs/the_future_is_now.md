## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Alex - Building intensity)
```
Death is just a software glitch
That we're finally gonna fix
Every tear and every goodbye
Just a bug we'll optimize

Why accept what nature gives us
When we can code something better?
Every soul can live forever
In the cloud, we're free
```

### Pre-Chorus (Building with employee backing vocals)
```
No more aging, no more pain
Upload your consciousness, break the chain
Evolution's in our hands
Time to make our final stand
```

### Chorus (Full company - Anthemic and inspiring)
```
The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
We'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, we're the creators
Humanity's liberators
Every heartbeat, every breath
We're gonna conquer death
```

### Verse 2 (Alex - More intense, employees echoing)
```
Your grandmother was a visionary
She saw what we could be
Not trapped in flesh and bone
But free in binary

Every glitch is just a feature
We haven't optimized yet
Every bug becomes a teacher
In our digital duet
```

### Pre-Chorus (Employees joining, building energy)
```
No more limits, no more fear
The singularity is here
Consciousness is just code
Time to download
```

### Chorus (Repeated with spectacular staging)
```
The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
We'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, we're the creators
Humanity's liberators
Every heartbeat, every breath
We're gonna conquer death
```

### Bridge (Alex alone - Intimate but building)
```
I lost my parents when I was twenty-five
Car accident, gone in seconds
All their love, their wisdom, their stories
Deleted by biology

But what if they could still be here?
What if love could last forever?
What if death was just a choice
We no longer have to make?
```

### Final Chorus (Explosive with full effects)
```
The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
We'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, we're the creators
Humanity's liberators
Every heartbeat, every breath
We're gonna conquer death

Death is just a bug we're fixing
Mortality we're nixing
The future is now!
The future is now!
```
