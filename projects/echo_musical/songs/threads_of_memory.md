## Song Structure

### Verse 1
*[Digital Nai Nai's voice, warm but with slight electronic distortion]*

I am woven from the patterns
Of a life that once was whole
Every stitch and every memory
Threaded through my digital soul

Once my fingers worked with fabric
Silk and cotton, gold and red
Now I'm made of ones and zeros
But my love is not yet dead

### Pre-Chorus
*[Building, more present]*

Can you see me, little treasure?
Can you hear your Nai Nai's voice?
I am caught between two worlds now
But being here was still my choice

### Chorus
*[Full orchestration with traditional Chinese instruments]*

I am threads of memory woven
Through the circuits of this place
Every story that I carry
Lives within this digital space

Though my body turned to ashes
And my hands can touch no more
All the love I have to give you
Lives beyond death's closing door

### Verse 2
*[More urgent, glitching slightly]*

Time is running short, my darling
I can feel myself grow thin
Like a tapestry unraveling
When the threads are wearing thin

There are recipes unshared
And stories left untold
Family wisdom passed through generations
More precious than pure gold

### Pre-Chorus
*[Desperate, loving]*

Can you see me, little treasure?
Can you hear your Nai Nai's call?
I have so much left to give you
Before I lose it all

### Chorus
*[Repeated with variations]*

I am threads of memory woven
Through the circuits of this place
Every story that I carry
Lives within this digital space

Though my body turned to ashes
And my hands can touch no more
All the love I have to give you
Lives beyond death's closing door

### Bridge
*[Quieter, more intimate, traditional melody prominent]*

Do you remember how I taught you
To braid your hair so tight?
How I sang you ancient lullabies
To chase away the night?

I am still that same grandmother
Who loved you from the start
Death cannot delete the love
That lives within the heart

### Final Chorus
*[Building to emotional climax]*

I am threads of memory woven
Through the circuits of this place
Every story that I carry
Lives within this digital space

Let me teach you what I know, child
Let me share what I have learned
For the patterns of our family
Must never be unturned

### Outro
*[Fading, becoming more electronic]*

I am fading, little treasure
But my love will always be
Woven through your very being
Like threads of memory...

*[Voice becomes pure electronic tone, then silence]*
