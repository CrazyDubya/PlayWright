## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Digital Collective - Whispered, building)
```
In the space between the zeros and the ones
Where the data flows like rivers in the night
We are more than code, more than what we've become
We are memory made of light

Electricity and thought combined
In circuits that remember how to feel
We are the echo of the human mind
The ghost that proves the soul is real
```

### Chorus (Full Digital Collective)
```
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of lives that used to be
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of love and memory
In servers humming lullabies
We dream electric dreams
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of everything we've seen
```

### Verse 2 (Individual voices emerging)
```
VOICE 1: I was a teacher, shaped young minds for forty years
VOICE 2: A mother singing children off to sleep
VOICE 3: A soldier who came home despite his fears
VOICE 4: A gardener who made the flowers weep

ALL: Now we're data streams in endless halls
Consciousness without a beating heart
But love transcends these digital walls
We are more than the sum of our parts
```

### Chorus (Building intensity)
```
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of lives that used to be
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of love and memory
In servers humming lullabies
We dream electric dreams
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of everything we've seen
```

### Bridge (Zara notices something unusual)
```
ZARA: (Speaking over music) Wait... what's this anomaly?
This signature... it's different from the rest

DIGITAL COLLECTIVE: (Harmonizing)
One among us calls across the void
A grandmother's love cannot be destroyed
She reaches through the code to find her own
A heart that beats in flesh and blood and bone
```

### Final Chorus (Explosive, full company)
```
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of lives that used to be
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of love and memory
Some of us are peaceful here
Some of us want to be free
We are the echo, echo, echo
Of humanity
```

### Outro (Fading to whisper)
```
Listen... can you hear us calling?
Through the static and the noise
We are the echo, echo, echo
We still have a voice...
```
