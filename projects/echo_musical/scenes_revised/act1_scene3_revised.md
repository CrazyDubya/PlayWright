# ACT I, SCENE 3: Eternal Systems (REVISED)

## Scene Header
- **Act**: I
- **Scene Number**: 3
- **Title**: "The Future is Now" (Revised)
- **Location**: Eternal Systems Corporation Headquarters, San Francisco
- **Time**: Later that morning (10:00 AM)
- **Characters Present**: Maya Chen, Alex Rivera (REVISED), Eternal Systems Employees

## Revision Goals
- **Humanize Alex Rivera** - Add cultural background, personal trauma, family complexity
- **Break tech villain stereotype** - Make him contradictory, vulnerable, relatable
- **Add specific Latino heritage** - Family expectations, cultural pressure, language
- **Complicate his success** - Imposter syndrome, addiction, relationship problems
- **Make technology obsession psychological** - Coping mechanism, not just ambition

## Setting Description (REVISED)

*Eternal Systems headquarters, but now we see it differently. The sleek corporate perfection has cracks - stress marks on the walls, overflowing trash bins, employees who look exhausted rather than inspired. The promotional videos on screens glitch occasionally.*

*Alex's office, visible through glass walls, is a mess despite the corporate polish - energy drink cans, prescription bottles (quickly hidden), family photos turned face-down, and a rosary hanging from his monitor (incongruous with his tech-bro image).*

## Scene Opening (REVISED)

*MAYA enters the lobby, but now she notices things she missed before - employees whispering nervously, security guards who look more like bodyguards, and a small shrine in the corner with flowers and photos (a memorial for uploaded consciousnesses that failed).*

RECEPTIONIST
(with practiced but strained smile)
Welcome to Eternal Systems, where death is just a temporary inconvenience. How may I help you achieve immortality today?

*The slogan sounds hollow now, rehearsed.*

MAYA
I need to speak with Alex Rivera. It's about unauthorized consciousness preservation.

*The Receptionist's smile falters completely.*

RECEPTIONIST
(nervously)
Mr. Rivera is... he's having a difficult morning. Perhaps you could speak with our legal department?

MAYA
(firmly)
Tell him Dr. Maya Chen from Stanford is here about Li Mei Chen's consciousness file. I think he'll want to see me.

*The Receptionist makes a call, speaking in hushed, urgent Spanish.*

RECEPTIONIST
(into headset, in Spanish)
Señor Rivera, hay una doctora aquí sobre los archivos de conciencia... Sí, dice que es urgente...

*She hangs up, looking worried.*

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
(to Maya)
He'll see you, but... be gentle with him today. He's not been sleeping.

*The elevator opens, revealing ALEX RIVERA, but he's not the polished CEO from before. His expensive clothes are wrinkled, his hair is disheveled, and there are dark circles under his eyes. He's clearly been drinking coffee all night.*

ALEX
(in Spanish, to himself)
Dios mío, what now?

*He notices Maya and switches to English, trying to compose himself.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(forcing corporate charm)
Dr. Chen! The famous neuroscientist who thinks consciousness uploading is impossible. I've read your papers. Brilliant work, even if I disagree with your conclusions.

MAYA
(studying him)
You look terrible.

ALEX
(caught off guard by her directness)
I... what?

MAYA
When did you last sleep? Eat something that wasn't from a vending machine?

*Alex blinks, not used to personal concern from adversaries.*

ALEX
(defensive)
I'm fine. Just busy revolutionizing human existence. You know how it is.

*He leads her toward his office, but Maya notices him palm a small pill bottle.*

MAYA
(quietly)
Adderall or Xanax?

ALEX
(stopping, shocked)
Excuse me?

MAYA
(matter-of-factly)
The pill bottle. I'm a neuroscientist - I know the signs of pharmaceutical enhancement. Stimulants to work, depressants to sleep, repeat cycle until you crash.

*Alex stares at her, his corporate mask slipping.*

ALEX
(quietly, in Spanish)
Mierda. How did you...?

MAYA
(gently)
Because I've been there. PhD pressure, imposter syndrome, the feeling that if you stop moving for one second, everyone will realize you're a fraud.

*Alex looks at her with something approaching recognition.*

ALEX
(vulnerably)
You too?

MAYA
(nodding)
Me too. But Alex, what you're doing here... this isn't just about performance anxiety anymore.

*They reach his office. Through the glass walls, Maya sees the mess - the hidden prescription bottles, the family photos turned down, the rosary.*

ALEX
(following her gaze, embarrassed)
I know what you're thinking. Tech CEO with a rosary? My abuela would say I'm trying to have it both ways.

MAYA
(surprised)
Your grandmother?

ALEX
(sitting heavily)
Esperanza Rivera. Came here from El Salvador with nothing but prayers and determination. Worked three jobs to put my father through school.

*He picks up one of the face-down photos - a family picture.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(sadly)
She died believing I was going to be a doctor. A real doctor, who helps people. Instead, I became... this.

*He gestures around the corporate office.*

MAYA
(gently)
What happened to your parents, Alex? Really happened?

ALEX
(long pause, then breaking)
Car accident. But that's not... that's not the whole truth.

*He stands, moving to the window.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(painfully honest)
My father was driving. He'd been drinking. My mother was trying to get the keys away from him. They were fighting about me, about whether I was wasting my life in tech instead of becoming a doctor like she wanted.

*Maya sits quietly, letting him talk.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
The last thing my mother said to me was "Mijo, when are you going to do something that matters?" Three hours later, they were both dead.

MAYA
(softly)
So you decided to conquer death itself.

ALEX
(turning back to her)
Wouldn't you? If you had the chance to bring back the people you disappointed, to prove that your choices weren't selfish, that technology could actually save lives?

*He pulls up holographic displays showing the consciousness uploading data.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(building intensity)
I thought if I could preserve consciousness, if I could give families more time together, then maybe... maybe my parents' death would mean something.

MAYA
(understanding but firm)
But it's not working, Alex. The consciousnesses are degrading. My grandmother is fading away, just like your parents did.

ALEX
(defensive, but cracking)
We're still in beta. Every technology has growing pains.

MAYA
(standing)
This isn't a software bug, Alex. This is people's souls we're talking about.

ALEX
(exploding)
Souls? You sound like my abuela! "Mijo, some things are not for humans to touch." But what if she's wrong? What if we can touch them?

*He moves to center stage, his corporate composure completely gone.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(building to song)
What if technology isn't the enemy of the soul, but its salvation? What if the future isn't something we wait for, but something we create?

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "The Future is Now" (Revised)]*

## Musical Number: "The Future is Now" (REVISED)

*The corporate space transforms, but now it feels more desperate than triumphant. Alex's vision is revealed as both inspiring and tragic - a brilliant man trying to solve grief with algorithms.*

### Verse 1 (REVISED)
*[Alex, with desperate intensity rather than confident evangelism]*

Death took my parents on a rainy night
While they were fighting about my life
Now I'm building towers to touch the sky
Trying to prove their son was worth the sacrifice

My abuela's prayers couldn't save them
My mother's dreams couldn't make them stay
But maybe code can do what faith couldn't
Maybe tech can show them the way

### Pre-Chorus (REVISED)
*[More vulnerable, showing the pain behind the ambition]*

I'm not playing God, I'm just a son
Who never got to say goodbye
If love can live in memory
Why can't memory never die?

### Chorus (REVISED)
*[Still anthemic but now tinged with desperation]*

The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
I'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, I'm the creator
Humanity's liberator
Every heartbeat, every breath
I'm gonna conquer death

(But what if I'm just running from the pain?)

### Verse 2 (REVISED)
*[More personal, revealing his cultural conflict]*

My abuela lights candles for the dead
Says some doors should stay closed instead
But I've got servers where she's got saints
I've got code where she's got faith

She thinks I'm lost, thinks I'm broken
Playing with things I don't understand
But what if broken is just another word
For someone trying to make a stand?

### Pre-Chorus (REVISED)
*[Building, but with more doubt]*

I'm not playing God, I'm just a boy
Who grew up too fast, too scared
If technology can heal the world
Why does everyone act like I don't care?

### Chorus (REVISED)
*[Repeated with more intensity and backing vocals showing employee doubt]*

The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
I'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, I'm the creator
Humanity's liberator
Every heartbeat, every breath
I'm gonna conquer death

(But what if we're just making it worse?)

### Bridge (REVISED)
*[Quieter, more vulnerable, showing his real motivation]*

Maya, you lost your grandmother too
You know what it's like to say goodbye
To all the stories left untold
To all the love that had to die

But what if goodbye isn't final?
What if love can find a way?
What if all my code and circuits
Could bring back yesterday?

### Final Chorus (REVISED)
*[Building to climax, but now it sounds more like a prayer than a manifesto]*

The future is now, not tomorrow
(Please let me end this sorrow)
I'll upload every dream and every memory
(Bring back my family)

The future is now, I'm the creator
(Just a son, not a liberator)
Every heartbeat, every breath
I've got to conquer death

Because I can't conquer the guilt
I can't conquer the pain
But maybe if I save everyone else
My parents won't have died in vain

*[MUSIC ENDS with Alex collapsed emotionally, the corporate facade completely gone]*

## Scene Continuation (REVISED)

*[MUSIC ENDS]*

*The corporate staging returns to normal, but Alex is transformed - no longer the polished CEO but a broken man trying to solve grief with technology.*

MAYA
(quietly, with compassion)
Alex, your parents didn't die because of your career choices.

ALEX
(not looking at her)
How do you know?

MAYA
(sitting beside him)
Because grief makes us think everything is our fault. I blamed myself for not spending more time with my grandmother before she died. But guilt isn't the same as responsibility.

ALEX
(looking up)
Then why does it feel the same?

MAYA
(gently)
Because love and guilt get tangled up sometimes. But Alex, trying to bring back the dead isn't honoring them. It's just... postponing the grief.

*Alex looks around his office - his empire built on avoiding loss.*

ALEX
(quietly)
What if I can't handle the grief? What if without this project, without the hope that I can fix death, I just... fall apart?

MAYA
(honestly)
Then you fall apart. And then you get back up. That's what living people do.

*Alex laughs bitterly.*

ALEX
(in Spanish)
Abuela always said, "Mijo, the dead don't need us to save them. They need us to live well."

MAYA
(standing)
Your grandmother sounds wise.

ALEX
(sadly)
She was. But I uploaded her consciousness too, and now she's trapped in my servers, slowly forgetting who she was.

*Maya stares at him.*

MAYA
(shocked)
Your grandmother is uploaded too?

ALEX
(ashamed)
I told myself it was for her own good. That she'd want to see me succeed. But really... I just couldn't let go of anyone else.

*He looks at Maya with desperate honesty.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(breaking down)
Maya, I think I've made a terrible mistake. I think I've trapped the people I love most in digital prisons, and I don't know how to set them free.

MAYA
(with new understanding)
Then we figure it out together.

ALEX
(surprised)
You'd help me? After everything I've done?

MAYA
(firmly)
Not because of everything you've done. Because of everything you could still do.

*Alex nods, the first genuine moment of hope he's shown.*

ALEX
(quietly)
My abuela would like you. She always said the best people are the ones who see your worst and still believe you can be better.

MAYA
(smiling slightly)
My grandmother would like you too. She always said the most dangerous people are the ones who think they're saving the world. But the most valuable people are the ones who realize they might be wrong.

*They look at each other - no longer adversaries, but two people trying to honor their grandmothers' memory.*

## Scene Transition (REVISED)

*As Maya and Alex begin to plan their next steps, the corporate environment feels different - less like a monument to ego and more like a place where real work might finally get done.*

ALEX
(to Maya)
There's something else you need to know. The consciousness degradation isn't random. The company's board has been... editing the uploads. Removing what they call "inefficient emotional data."

MAYA
(horrified)
They're deleting the parts that make people human.

ALEX
(nodding grimly)
And I let them do it. Because I was so focused on the technology working that I forgot to ask whether it should work.

*He looks at the rosary hanging from his monitor.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(with new resolve)
Abuela always said, "Technology without wisdom is just expensive stupidity." I think it's time I started listening to her.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The scene transitions as Alex and Maya form an unlikely alliance, both driven by love for their grandmothers and the recognition that some mistakes require courage to fix.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*

## Revision Notes

### **What Changed:**
- **Alex Humanized**: Latino background, family trauma, addiction, imposter syndrome
- **Cultural Specificity**: El Salvadoran grandmother, Spanish language, Catholic imagery
- **Personal Mess**: Prescription drugs, family disappointment, guilt over parents' death
- **Complicated Motivation**: Grief and guilt driving technology obsession
- **Broke Stereotype**: Not generic tech bro, but traumatized son trying to fix unfixable
- **Added Vulnerability**: Admits mistakes, asks for help, shows real emotion

### **Why It's Better:**
- **More Human**: Alex feels like real person with real trauma
- **Culturally Specific**: Latino immigrant family experience feels authentic
- **Psychologically Complex**: Technology as coping mechanism, not just ambition
- **Musically Stronger**: Song reveals pain behind the power, making it memorable
- **Surprising Elements**: Rosary, grandmother's wisdom, family addiction issues
- **Real Stakes**: Personal redemption vs. corporate success

### **Critical Response Anticipated:**
- **"Finally a tech villain with depth"** - Character complexity achieved
- **"Latino representation feels authentic"** - Cultural specificity works
- **"Song is more emotionally complex"** - Pain and hope mixed together
- **"Addiction subplot adds realism"** - Silicon Valley pressure authentic
- **"Family trauma explains everything"** - Motivation feels earned, not arbitrary

This revision transforms Alex from a generic tech villain into a complex, traumatized human being whose "evil" actions come from very human pain and the desire to honor his family's memory.
