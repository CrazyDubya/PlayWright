## LYRICS

### **Opening - Ensemble**
*(Suburban shoppers going about their normal routine)*

**ENSEMBLE**: *(overlapping, creating rhythm)*
Organic produce, gluten-free bread  
Soccer practice, kids to be fed  
Coupon clipping, budget tight  
Another ordinary Tuesday night  

Shopping lists and meal prep plans  
Minivans and wedding bands  
Everything is as it seems  
In our suburban shopping dreams  

### **Verse 1 - CLAIRE**
*(Entering with confidence, checking her phone)*

David's text came in at nine  
"Grocery shopping, look divine  
Wear the dress, you know the one  
Make this trip a little fun"  

*(She adjusts her dress, checks herself in phone camera)*

No panties, just like he said  
Feeling dangerous, feeling fed  
By the power of his attention  
This delicious new dimension  

### **Verse 1 - JESSICA**
*(Entering from opposite side, also checking phone)*

Got my orders, crystal clear  
"Show them all what I hold dear  
Make them wonder, make them stare  
Show them you belong to me, my dear"  

*(She moves more provocatively, aware of being watched)*

Remote control tucked away  
He decides when I can play  
Every step a sweet reminder  
Of the man who chose to find her  

### **Pre-Chorus - BOTH**
*(They notice each other across the produce section)*

**CLAIRE**: Wait, is that...?  
**JESSICA**: Oh my God...  
**BOTH**: What is she doing here?  
**CLAIRE**: This is my store  
**JESSICA**: This is my dare  
**BOTH**: Something isn't right, I fear  

### **Chorus - Competition Begins**
*(Music builds as they start competing for attention)*

**CLAIRE**: Watch me bend to get the milk  
**JESSICA**: See me move like liquid silk  
**BOTH**: Every eye upon us now  
**CLAIRE**: I'll show them how  
**JESSICA**: I'll show them how  
**BOTH**: To make a simple shopping trip  
Into something they can't skip  

**ENSEMBLE**: *(confused but intrigued)*
Something's different in the air  
Something's happening over there  
Why are they moving like that?  
What's beneath this normal chat?  

### **Verse 2 - CLAIRE**
*(Moving through frozen foods, increasingly bold)*

Reaching high for frozen peas  
Letting my dress ride up with ease  
David said to make them wonder  
What's beneath this suburban thunder  

*(Her phone buzzes)*

"Good girl, now the wine aisle  
Make it worth their while"  

### **Verse 2 - JESSICA**
*(In the wine section, one-upping Claire)*

Bending low to read the labels  
Showing off what I am able  
To display without a care  
David's watching everywhere  

*(Her phone buzzes)*

"Perfect, now the checkout line  
Show them you are mine"  

### **Bridge - The Revelation**
*(They end up in the same checkout line)*

**CLAIRE**: *(suspicious)*
Funny how we both got here  

**JESSICA**: *(defensive)*
Just shopping, nothing weird  

**CLAIRE**: *(checking her phone)*
David said to meet him at...  

**JESSICA**: *(checking hers)*
David said... oh shit  

**BOTH**: *(realization dawning)*
David...  
David...  
DAVID!  

### **Ensemble Interlude**
*(The shoppers start to notice the tension)*

**CASHIER**: Paper or plastic, ladies?  

**SHOPPER 1**: Are they having some kind of fight?  

**SHOPPER 2**: Over what? They're both so pretty  

**SHOPPER 3**: Something's not quite right  

**ENSEMBLE**: 
In our safe suburban bubble  
Nothing's supposed to cause trouble  
But these women seem to be  
Fighting over something we can't see  

### **Final Chorus - Full Competition**
*(Both women going all out, ensemble watching in fascination)*

**CLAIRE**: I was here first, this is my game  
**JESSICA**: Honey, we're not playing the same  
**BOTH**: David chose me, David wants me  
**CLAIRE**: I'm the one he came to see  
**JESSICA**: I'm the one he came to free  
**BOTH**: From this suburban prison  

**ENSEMBLE**: *(building excitement)*
Something's happening in our store  
Something we've not seen before  
These perfect wives are coming alive  
Right here in aisle five!  

### **Climax - The Challenge**
*(Music reaches peak intensity)*

**JESSICA**: *(bold)*
You think you know what David wants?  

**CLAIRE**: *(matching her)*
I know exactly what he wants  

**JESSICA**: Then prove it  

**CLAIRE**: How?  

**JESSICA**: Right here, right now  
Show everyone who wears the crown  

**BOTH**: *(to the ensemble)*
You want a show? We'll give you one  
You want to see what we've become?  
Watch us break your suburban rules  
Watch us play by different tools  

### **Outro - The Aftermath**
*(Music winds down, reality setting in)*

**ENSEMBLE**: *(whispered, scandalized)*
Did that really just happen here?  
In our safe suburban sphere?  
What will we tell our husbands when  
We get home to them again?  

**CLAIRE & JESSICA**: *(looking at their phones)*
David's text: "Well done, my dears  
You've given them something to fear  
Meet me tonight, both of you  
We have more work to do"  

**ENSEMBLE**: *(final whisper)*
Organic produce, gluten-free bread  
But now we've got these thoughts instead  
Of what we saw in aisle five  
And how it made us feel alive...  

*(Music ends with the sound of shopping carts and checkout beeps)*

## Performance Notes

### **Vocal Considerations**
- **Claire**: Mezzo-soprano, confident and sensual
- **Jessica**: Soprano, more aggressive and competitive
- **Ensemble**: Mixed voices creating suburban harmony with growing discord
- **Overlapping**: Complex harmonies showing different perspectives

### **Acting Beats**
1. **Normal Shopping**: Establish the mundane suburban routine
2. **Individual Confidence**: Each woman following David's instructions
3. **Recognition**: They realize they're both playing the same game
4. **Competition**: Escalating attempts to outdo each other
5. **Public Display**: Breaking suburban norms in front of neighbors
6. **Aftermath**: Dealing with the consequences of their actions

### **Choreography Notes**
- **Shopping as Dance**: Mundane movements become choreographed
- **Cart Choreography**: Shopping carts as dance partners and props
- **Levels**: Use shelving and store layout for dynamic staging
- **Ensemble Reactions**: Shoppers gradually becoming more aware and interested
- **Competition**: Physical one-upmanship between Claire and Jessica
- **Finale**: Both women claiming space and attention

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Full Supermarket Set**: Multiple aisles, checkout lanes, realistic props
- **Shopping Carts**: Must be safe for choreography
- **Phone Integration**: Text messages visible to audience
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent to dramatic as tension builds
- **Sound**: Realistic store sounds (beeping, announcements) integrated into music

### **Costume Notes**
- **Claire**: Dress that allows for provocative movement, gradually becoming disheveled
- **Jessica**: More overtly sexy outfit, showing her competitive nature
- **Ensemble**: Realistic suburban shopping attire
- **Props**: Hidden toys/devices that suggest the women's secret games

## Director's Notes

This number serves multiple functions:
1. Introduces Jessica as Claire's rival and fellow submissive
2. Shows how David is manipulating multiple women
3. Reveals that the "perfect" suburban community is hungry for excitement
4. Escalates the stakes by making the games public
5. Sets up the neighborhood as complicit in the drama

The ensemble should represent the audience's own voyeuristic fascination with the breakdown of suburban perfection. They're scandalized but also excited by what they're witnessing.

The competition between Claire and Jessica should feel both sexy and sad - two women fighting for the attention of a man who's playing them against each other.

## Cultural Commentary

- The hunger for excitement beneath perfect facades
- Social media culture of performing private moments publicly

### **Female Competition**
- Women turned against each other instead of recognizing shared manipulation
- The way patriarchal systems pit women against each other
- Competition for male attention as learned behavior

### **Public vs. Private**
- The breakdown between public and private behavior
- How digital culture has made everything performative
- The thrill and danger of being seen

## The Deeper Meaning

"Supermarket Seduction" is about the hunger for authentic experience in a world of artificial perfection. The suburban shoppers are drawn to Claire and Jessica's display not because it's shocking, but because it's real - these women are actually feeling something, wanting something, being something other than perfect.

The song also reveals how David's games are expanding beyond individual relationships to affect the entire community. He's not just manipulating Claire and Jessica - he's orchestrating a breakdown of suburban social norms.

The ensemble's fascination mirrors the audience's own voyeuristic interest in the story. We're all complicit in wanting to see the perfect facade crack.

**This is where the personal becomes political, where private desires become public spectacle, and where the whole neighborhood becomes part of David's elaborate psychological game.**
