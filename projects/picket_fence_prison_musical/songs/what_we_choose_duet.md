## LYRICS

### **Opening - Rosa's Disappointment**
*(Rosa packing her cleaning supplies, Claire watching)*

**ROSA**: 
Six months later, here we are  
You in pieces, me still cleaning  
Was it worth it, your falling star?  
All this mess you've been creating?  

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa, please, just let me explain...  

**ROSA**: 
Explain what, Señora? The pain  
You caused your husband, your family?  
The choices that set you free?  

### **Verse 1 - The Debate Begins**

**CLAIRE**: 
You think I'm selfish, I know you do  
But I was dying in that perfect life  
You think I should have just pushed through  
Twenty more years as Michael's wife  

**ROSA**: 
I think you had options you didn't try  
Counseling, talking, working it out  
Instead you chose to live a lie  
While your marriage fell apart  

**CLAIRE**: 
But what if talking couldn't fix  
What was broken from the start?  
What if some problems can't be mixed  
With compromise and hopeful heart?  

**ROSA**: 
Then you leave with dignity  
Not sneak around with other men  
You face the truth honestly  
Not pretend and play pretend  

### **Chorus - The Core Disagreement**

**ROSA**: 
What we choose defines who we are  
Not what we feel or what we want  
**CLAIRE**: 
What we choose should heal our scars  
Not just do what others want  

**ROSA**: 
Choices have consequences, mija  
**CLAIRE**: 
So does never choosing at all  
**ROSA**: 
You can't just think of yourself  
**CLAIRE**: 
I spent twenty years thinking of everyone else  

**BOTH**: 
What we choose, what we choose  
Shows the world what we value most  
**ROSA**: 
Responsibility  
**CLAIRE**: 
Authenticity  
**BOTH**: 
What we choose  

### **Verse 2 - Getting Deeper**

**ROSA**: 
You had money, you had time  
You had resources I don't have  
You could have made your marriage shine  
Instead you chose this other path  

**CLAIRE**: 
You're right, I had privileges  
But privilege doesn't heal a heart  
Money can't buy what marriage is  
When love has fallen apart  

**ROSA**: 
Love is work, not just feeling  
Love is choice, not just desire  
Love is staying and healing  
Not running when you tire  

**CLAIRE**: 
But what if staying means dying?  
What if healing means pretending?  
What if love means lying  
About who you are inside?  

### **Bridge - Finding Common Ground**

**ROSA**: *(softer)*
I know about dying inside, Señora  
When my husband passed away  
I wanted to give up, to run away  
But I had children to feed  

**CLAIRE**: *(understanding)*
And I know about responsibility  
I raised two daughters, built a home  
But when they left, I was alone  
With a stranger I called husband  

**ROSA**: 
So we both know sacrifice  

**CLAIRE**: 
And we both know the price  
Of putting others first  

**ROSA**: 
But maybe there's a way  
To honor both our truths  

**CLAIRE**: 
Maybe there's a way  
To choose without destroying  

### **Final Chorus - Resolution**

**ROSA**: 
What we choose defines who we are  
**CLAIRE**: 
What we choose should honor our truth  
**ROSA**: 
Choices have consequences  
**CLAIRE**: 
So does living without choice  

**BOTH**: 
What we choose, what we choose  
Shows the world what we believe  
Some choose safety  
Some choose growth  
Some choose to stay  
Some choose to leave  

**ROSA**: 
I choose to work and provide  
**CLAIRE**: 
I choose to feel and explore  
**ROSA**: 
I choose my family's pride  
**CLAIRE**: 
I choose to not ignore  
**BOTH**: 
The voice inside that says  
There has to be something more  

### **Outro - The Goodbye**

**ROSA**: *(packing the last of her supplies)*
I won't be coming back, Señora  
Not because I hate you  
But because I can't watch you  
Destroy what I can't have  

**CLAIRE**: 
I understand. And Rosa?  
Thank you for seeing me  
Even when you didn't like  
What you saw  

**ROSA**: 
Take care of yourself, Claire  
And maybe... learn to cook  
You're going to need it  

**CLAIRE**: *(small smile)*
Maybe I will  

**ROSA**: 
And Claire? Next time you choose...  
Choose with your eyes open  
Not just your heart  

**CLAIRE**: 
I will. I promise.  

*(Rosa exits. Claire stands alone)*

**CLAIRE**: *(final line)*
What we choose...  
What we choose...  

*(Music fades)*

## Director's Notes

This duet should feel like a real conversation between two women who respect each other but fundamentally disagree. Neither is completely right or wrong.

Rosa represents the audience's practical concerns, Claire represents the desire for authentic living. Both perspectives have merit.

The song should end with mutual understanding, not victory for either side. They agree to disagree with dignity.

## The Deeper Meaning

"What We Choose" presents the central moral question of the musical without providing easy answers. Rosa and Claire represent different approaches to life's challenges.

Rosa chooses responsibility, family, and sacrifice. Claire chooses authenticity, growth, and self-discovery. Both choices have costs and benefits.

The duet argues that there's no single right way to live, but that we must own the consequences of our choices. Rosa chooses stability, Claire chooses change - both are valid.

The song doesn't resolve the moral tension - it honors it. Some people choose safety, some choose growth. Some stay, some leave. What matters is choosing consciously, not just reacting.

**This is the transcendence: showing two different but equally valid approaches to life's challenges, letting the audience decide which resonates with them.**

**The musical doesn't tell you what to choose - it shows you the cost and beauty of choosing at all.**
