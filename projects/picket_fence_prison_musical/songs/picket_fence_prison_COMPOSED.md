## COMPLETE LEAD SHEET

### INTRO (8 bars) - "Morning Routine"
*Minimalist piano figure representing mechanical daily routine*

```
| Gmaj7    | Gmaj7    | Em7      | Em7      |
| (Piano ostinato: quarter note pattern, clock-like)         |

| Cmaj7    | D/C      | Gmaj7    | G        |
| (Strings enter bar 5, building warmth that feels hollow)   |
```

**Musical Idea**: Repeating 4-note pattern (G-B-D-E) representing the "rinse and repeat" of Claire's life. Deceptively pretty but mechanical.

---

### VERSE 1 (16 bars)
*Claire moves through morning routine - conversational, intimate*

```
| G        | G/B      | C        | D        |
| Cof-fee at| sev-en   | yo-ga at | eight    |

| Em       | D/F#     | C        | Dsus4  D |
| Vol-un-teer| meet-ing | can't be  | late     |

| G        | G/B      | C        | Cm       |
| Check the Ring| cam-era | wave at the| street   |

| Em       | D        | C        | D        |
| Per-fect per-| for-mance| rinse and re-| peat    |

| G        | G/B      | C        | D        |
| Twen-ty five| years of the| same rou-| tine    |

| Em       | D/F#     | C        | Dsus4 D  |
| Play-ing the| part of sub-| ur-ban   | queen   |

| Am       | Am/G     | D/F#     | D        |
| But when did I| stop and when| did I    | start   |

| Em       | C        | D        | D        |
| Just go-ing through| mo-tions with-| out an-y | heart?  |
```

**Melodic Contour**:
- Bars 1-8: Small intervals, confined range (D4-B4), reflecting routine
- Bars 9-16: Range expands (D4-D5), voice rising with growing awareness

---

### PRE-CHORUS (8 bars)
*Building intensity, Claire's voice becoming more urgent*

```
| Am       | Am/G     | F        | F        |
| I used to| dream of | some-thing| more     |

| C        | D        | Em       | Em       |
| Than match-ing| tow-els and| mar-ble  | floors   |

| Am       | Am/G     | F        | F        |
| I used to| burn I   | used to  | feel     |

| C        | D        | Dsus4    | D        |
| Now noth-ing| here seems| e-ven   | real     |
```

**Harmonic Movement**: Shifting to relative minor territory (Am), creating tension before chorus release.

---

### CHORUS (16 bars) - THE HOOK
*Full voice, truth breaking through - tempo increases slightly to 84 BPM*

```
| Em       | C        | G        | D        |
| These PICK-et| FEN-ces feel| like    | BARS     |

| Em       | C        | G/B      | D        |
| And this dream| house is my| pri-son | YARD     |

| Em       | C        | G        | D/F#     |
| I'm SERV-ing| TIME for a | crime I  | did-n't  |

| Em       | C        | Am       | D        |
| com-MIT   | Be-ing the| wo-man I | thought I|

| G        | G/B      | C        | Cm       |
| was sup- | posed to  | be       | eeee     |

| G        | D/F#     | Em       | Em       |
| Per-fect lawn| per-fect life| per-fect | wife    |

| Am       | D        | G        | G/B      |
| But I'm  | DY-ing in-| side this per-| fect    |

| C        | Cm       | G        | D        |
| life These| pick-et fen-| ces white and| clean   |

| Em       | C        | Am       | D        |
| Are the walls| of my sub-| ur-ban  | pri-son  |
```

**Key Musical Features**:
1. **The Hook Rhythm**: "PICK-et FEN-ces" = syncopated (♩ ♪ ♩ ♪) creating memorable rhythmic signature
2. **Harmonic Surprise**: Cm chord under "be" (bar 5 of chorus) - borrowed from parallel minor, adding emotional weight
3. **Melodic Peak**: "DYING" hits the high D5, emotional climax

### VERSE 2 (16 bars)
*Claire making Michael's lunch - more emotional*

```
| G        | G/B      | C        | D        |
| Mich-ael's| lunch packed| his cof-fee| poured   |

| Em       | D/F#     | C        | Dsus4 D  |
| He'll grunt| "thanks babe"| and head out| the door |

| G        | G/B      | C        | Cm       |
| Twen-ty years| mar-ried we| bare-ly  | speak    |

| Em       | D        | C        | D        |
| Just two | stran-gers| shar-ing the| same tech-|

| Am       | Am       | D        | D        |
| nique    |          |          |          |

| Em       | D/F#     | C        | Dsus4 D  |
| The girls are| at col-lege| liv-ing their| dreams  |

| Am       | Am/G     | D/F#     | D        |
| While I'm still| here burst-ing| at the   | seams   |

| Em       | C        | D        | D        |
| They think I'm| hap-py they| think I'm | fine    |

| Am       | C        | D        | Dsus4 D  |
| But I'm dis-| ap-pear-ing| one day at| a time   |
```

### BRIDGE (12 bars) - "The Breaking Point"
*Music drops to almost nothing, Claire sits at kitchen table*
*Time signature shifts to 6/8 for introspection*

BRASS (sparse):
- French Horn (sustained swells only)
```

### Orchestral Texture Map
```

VERSE 1:       Piano + guitar, light strings
PRE-CHORUS:    Add bass, drums (brushes), fuller strings
CHORUS 1:      Full band, strings swelling
VERSE 2:       Strip back, cello prominent
PRE-CHORUS 2:  Building again, add woodwinds
CHORUS 2:      Full, more aggressive

## SUNO/UDIO PROMPT

```
Generate a contemporary musical theater ballad for mezzo-soprano voice.
Tempo starts at 72 BPM, builds to 96 BPM by final chorus.

Style: Contemporary Broadway - similar to Sara Bareilles (Waitress),
Pasek & Paul (Dear Evan Hansen), or Cyndi Lauper (Kinky Boots).
Emotional, building, with piano-driven verses and full orchestral chorus.

Key: G major with minor key sections. Time signature 4/4.

Mood: Starts with mechanical perfection masking emptiness, builds through
desperation to a glimmer of hope. A woman realizing her perfect life is a prison.

Instrumentation: Piano foundation, acoustic guitar, strings quartet,
light drums with brushes building to full kit. Intimate to powerful arc.

[VERSE 1]
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight
Volunteer meeting, can't be late
Check the Ring camera, wave at the street
Perfect performance, rinse and repeat

[PRE-CHORUS]
I used to dream of something more
Than matching towels and marble floors
I used to burn, I used to feel
Now nothing here seems even real

[CHORUS]
These picket fences feel like bars
And this dream house is my prison yard
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be

Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife
But I'm dying inside this perfect life
These picket fences, white and clean
Are the walls of my suburban prison
```

## HARMONIC ANALYSIS

### Key Centers
- **Verse**: G major (tonic) - safety, normalcy
- **Pre-Chorus**: A minor (ii) - growing unease
- **Chorus**: E minor (vi) - the truth revealed
- **Bridge**: E minor → builds back to G - transformation
- **Final Chorus**: E minor → G major - hope emerging

### Notable Harmonic Devices

1. **Modal Mixture (Cm chord)**
   - Borrowed from G minor (parallel minor)
   - Creates "bitter" quality on words like "be" and "life"
   - Signature sound of the show

2. **Deceptive Cadence (Bridge ending)**
   - Expected: D → G
   - Actual: D → Em (vi)
   - Keeps tension, delays resolution

3. **Pedal Point (Intro)**
   - G pedal under changing harmonics
   - Represents stasis of Claire's life

---

## VOCAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Range
```
Lowest Note:  D4 (verse, "repeat")
Highest Note: D5 (chorus, "DYING")
Tessitura:    G4 - B4 (comfortable mezzo range)
```

### Technical Demands
- **Breath Control**: Long phrases in chorus (4+ bars)
- **Dynamic Range**: pp (whispered outro) to ff (final chorus)
- **Belt**: Required on "DYING," "BARS," "PRISON"
- **Mix Voice**: Pre-chorus sits in passaggio
- **Legato**: Verses require smooth, connected line

### Emotional Map
```
VERSE 1:      Mechanical, pleasant mask
PRE-CHORUS 1: Mask slipping, vulnerability showing
CHORUS 1:     Truth erupting, desperate
VERSE 2:      Deeper sadness, more personal
PRE-CHORUS 2: Anger emerging under sadness
CHORUS 2:     Full desperation
BRIDGE:       Complete breakdown → rebuilding
FINAL CHORUS: Desperation + hope = complex
OUTRO:        Quiet determination
```
