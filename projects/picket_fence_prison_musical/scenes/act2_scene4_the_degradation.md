## **SCENE 4 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Dinner Setup**
*(Lights up on David's living room, elegantly arranged for dinner. JESSICA kneels beside the couch, wearing an expensive collar and minimal designer clothing, serving as a human side table with a tray balanced on her back. DAVID and CLAIRE sit at a small table.)*

**DAVID**: *(pouring wine)*
I thought we should talk privately about what happened last night.

**CLAIRE**: *(uncomfortable, glancing at Jessica)*
Privately?

**DAVID**: 
Jessica understands her role tonight. Don't you, pet?

**JESSICA**: *(from her position)*
Yes, Sir. I'm here to serve.

**CLAIRE**: *(disturbed)*
David, she's a person, not furniture.

**DAVID**: 
She's exactly what she chooses to be, Claire. Aren't you, Jessica?

**JESSICA**: 
Yes, Sir. This is what I want.

### **SONG: "FINEST THINGS" (Jessica's Gilded Cage)**

**JESSICA**: *(starting quietly, from her position)*
Cartier collar, eighteen karat gold  
Hermès leash, hand-stitched and bold  
La Perla lingerie, barely there  
Louboutin heels for crawling wear  

*(Touching each expensive item)*

Custom-made position, Italian design  
Crystal water bowl, vintage wine  
Silk cushions for my knees to rest  
When I'm serving at my very best  

Everything money can buy  
Everything money can buy  
But look into my eyes  
And tell me what you find  

Behind these finest things  
Behind these golden rings  
There's nothing left of me  
Just expensive emptiness  

*(Voice becoming more desperate)*

I have the finest things that money can afford  
Designer degradation, luxury abhorred  
Every chain that binds me costs more than most make  
In a year of honest living, but make no mistake  

I'm still a prisoner, just in prettier bars  
I'm still a broken woman counting money like stars  
I have the finest things, the finest things  
But I'm worth nothing, worth nothing  
In these finest things  

### **Claire's Growing Discomfort**

**CLAIRE**: *(to David, disturbed)*
This doesn't feel right.

**DAVID**: 
What doesn't feel right?

**CLAIRE**: 
Using her like this. Making her into... an object.

**DAVID**: 
I'm not making her into anything. She chose this role.

**JESSICA**: *(from her position)*
Claire, this is what I want. This is where I belong.

**CLAIRE**: *(standing)*
No one belongs on the floor like furniture.

**DAVID**: *(calmly)*
Sit down, Claire.

*(CLAIRE automatically starts to sit, then catches herself)*

**CLAIRE**: 
No. I won't sit while she kneels.

### **Jessica's Justification**

**JESSICA**: *(continuing her song)*
You think this is degrading  
You think this makes me small  
But I've never felt more valued  
I've never felt more tall  

*(Building intensity)*

You can keep your liberation  
You can keep your empowerment  
I found my salvation  
In this strange arrangement  

This is where I belong  
In the spaces between your definitions  
This is where I'm strong  
In my chosen submission  

*(Voice cracking)*

Some people find themselves in boardrooms  
Some people find themselves in love  
Some people find themselves in motherhood  
Some people find themselves above  
The need to be understood  
By anyone but themselves  

I found myself here  
In this collar, in this care  
In this service, in this prayer  
That I am enough  
Exactly as I am  
In this place where I belong  

### **The Confrontation**

**CLAIRE**: *(to Jessica)*
Jessica, get up.

**JESSICA**: *(confused)*
I... Sir didn't give me permission.

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
Tell her she can get up.

**DAVID**: 
Why would I do that? She's comfortable where she is.

**CLAIRE**: 
She's not comfortable. She's performing comfort.

**DAVID**: 
And what are you performing, Claire?

**CLAIRE**: *(realizing)*
I... what do you mean?

**DAVID**: 
You're performing moral superiority. You're performing concern. But you're here, aren't you? You're participating.

**CLAIRE**: 
That's different.

**DAVID**: 
Is it? You're both here by choice. You're both getting something you want.

### **Claire's Realization**

**CLAIRE**: *(looking at Jessica, then at David)*
What am I getting?

**DAVID**: 
You're getting to feel special. Superior. Chosen.

**CLAIRE**: *(horrified)*
That's not... I don't...

**DAVID**: 
You don't what? Feel superior to Jessica? Feel grateful that you're the one I'm having dinner with while she serves us?

**CLAIRE**: *(backing away)*
Stop.

**DAVID**: 
You're both performing, Claire. She's performing degradation, you're performing empowerment. But you're both here for the same reason.

**CLAIRE**: 
What reason?

**DAVID**: 
You both need to be chosen.

### **Jessica's Final Verse**

**JESSICA**: *(from the floor, to Claire)*
You want to save me, but I don't need saving  
You want to lift me up, but I chose to kneel  
You want to give me dignity, but I'm not craving  
What you think I should feel  

*(Standing slowly, without permission)*

I have the finest things, and I chose them all  
The collar, the position, the beautiful fall  
From who I used to be to who I am now  
And I won't let you tell me that I don't know how  

To choose my own life, my own way to be  
Even if it looks like slavery to you and me  
I found my place in this expensive cage  
And I won't apologize for my chosen stage  

### **The Breaking Point**

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
Is this what you want from me? Eventually?

**DAVID**: 
I want from you what you're willing to give.

**CLAIRE**: 
And if I'm willing to give everything?

**DAVID**: 
Then I'll take everything.

**CLAIRE**: *(looking at Jessica)*
And when there's nothing left?

**DAVID**: 
There's always something left.

**CLAIRE**: *(pointing to Jessica)*
What's left of her?

*(Long pause)*

**JESSICA**: *(quietly)*
Enough.

**CLAIRE**: *(to Jessica)*
Is it? Is it really enough?

**JESSICA**: *(uncertain for the first time)*
It has to be.

### **Final Moment**

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
I need to think about this.

**DAVID**: 
Of course. Take all the time you need.

**CLAIRE**: *(to Jessica)*
And you? Do you need time to think?

**JESSICA**: *(back in position)*
I've already chosen, Claire. This is who I am.

**CLAIRE**: *(sadly)*
No, Jessica. This is who you've decided to be. There's a difference.

*(CLAIRE exits, leaving DAVID and JESSICA alone)*

**DAVID**: *(to Jessica)*
She'll understand eventually.

**JESSICA**: *(quietly)*
Will she? Or will she choose something different?

**DAVID**: *(not answering)*
Resume your position.

**JESSICA**: *(hesitating for the first time)*
Yes... Sir.

*(Lights fade as she kneels again, but with less certainty)*

- **The question**: Will Claire choose herself over being chosen?

**This scene shows the cost of Jessica's "empowerment" and Claire's growing awareness that being chosen isn't the same as being valued.**
