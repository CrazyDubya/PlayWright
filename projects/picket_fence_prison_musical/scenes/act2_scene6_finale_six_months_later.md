## **SCENE 6 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Empty House**
*(Lights up on Claire's former kitchen. MICHAEL sits alone with takeout containers and his laptop. The house feels abandoned despite his presence.)*

**MICHAEL**: *(to himself, scrolling)*
"Day 247 of my awakening journey. Today we're exploring what it means to be truly alone..."

*(He's watching Jessica's content, which has become more desperate)*

She gets it. She understands what it's like to be abandoned.

*(His phone buzzes with a notification)*

"Your wife Claire Morrison has updated her location to Portland, Oregon."

*(He stares at the notification)*

Six months. She's been gone six months, and I still don't understand why.

### **Claire in Portland**
*(Lights up on a small apartment. CLAIRE sits at a simple table, writing in a journal. She looks healthy, confident, at peace.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(reading from her journal)*
"Day 180 in Portland. I got a job at a bookstore. It doesn't pay much, but I wake up every morning knowing exactly who I am. No performance required."

*(She closes the journal)*

David still texts sometimes. "When are you coming home?" "I'm waiting for you." "You can't run from what you are."

*(She deletes the messages without reading them)*

But I'm not running from anything. I'm running toward myself.

### **David's New Game**
*(Lights up on David's study. He's on a video call with a new woman - STEPHANIE, 35, recently divorced.)*

**DAVID**: *(on screen)*
Stephanie, you look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time.

**STEPHANIE**: *(on screen)*
How did you... how did you know that?

**DAVID**: 
I see you, Stephanie. Really see you. Would you like to explore what that means?

*(He ends the call and makes notes)*

**DAVID**: *(to himself)*
Claire was a setback, not a failure. She was too strong, too independent. Stephanie is recently divorced, vulnerable, desperate for validation.

*(He looks at a photo of Claire)*

You think you won, don't you? You think choosing yourself makes you free. But you'll be back. They always come back.

### **Jessica's Doubt**
*(Lights up on Jessica's bedroom studio. She sits in front of her camera, but it's not recording. She wears her expensive collar but touches it uncertainly.)*

**JESSICA**: *(to her reflection)*
"Day 247 of my awakening journey..."

*(She stops)*

What journey? I'm in the same place I was a year ago. The same position. The same... cage.

*(She looks at her bank account on her phone)*

Six figures. I have six figures in the bank. I'm financially independent. I'm successful.

*(She touches the collar)*

So why do I feel like I'm disappearing?

### **Rosa's New Perspective**
*(Lights up on Rosa cleaning a different house. She speaks to the audience.)*

**ROSA**: 
Six months later, and I'm cleaning different houses with the same problems. Rich people who forgot how to be grateful. Rich people who think money solves everything.

But sometimes... sometimes one of them surprises you.

*(She pulls out her phone, showing a text from Claire)*

"Rosa, I got promoted to assistant manager at the bookstore. I'm thinking of taking night classes. Thank you for teaching me the difference between choosing and being chosen. - Claire"

*(She smiles)*

Sometimes they remember how to choose themselves.

### **The Neighborhood**
*(Lights up on the cul-de-sac. NEIGHBORS appear at windows and doorways, checking their phones.)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: Did you see David Sterling has a new woman coming around?

**NEIGHBOR 2**: Younger than Claire. Prettier than Jessica.

**NEIGHBOR 3**: I wonder if she knows about his... hobbies.

**NEIGHBOR 4**: Should we warn her?

**ALL**: *(pause)*
Nah. Let's just watch and see what happens.

*(They all go back to their phones)*

### **SONG: "WHAT WE'VE BECOME" (Full Company Finale)**

**CLAIRE**: *(from Portland)*
I am not the woman I was supposed to be  
I am the woman I chose to become  
Complex, contradictory, free  
In ways I never could have imagined  

**DAVID**: *(from his study)*
I am not the hero of this story  
I am not the villain either  
I am a man who loves through control  
And I've stopped apologizing for my nature  

**JESSICA**: *(from her studio)*
I am not your cautionary tale  
I am not your inspiration  
I am a woman who found her place  
And I'm starting to question that location  

**MICHAEL**: *(from the empty house)*
I am not the husband I was supposed to be  
I am exactly what I chose to become  
Alone with my screens and my regret  
And the wife I never really knew  

**ROSA**: *(from her new job)*
I am not your moral authority  
I am just a woman who works  
Who sees what people choose to do  
With the privileges that I lack  

**ENSEMBLE**: *(from the neighborhood)*
We are not the community we pretend to be  
We are exactly what we've always been  
Watchers, consumers, voyeurs  
Feeding on each other's pain  

### **The Cycle Continues**

**DAVID**: *(typing to Stephanie)*
"You're different from other women, Stephanie. Special. Would you like to discover just how special?"

**STEPHANIE**: *(on screen, eager)*
Yes. Yes, I would.

**JESSICA**: *(to her camera, but not recording)*
Maybe Claire was right. Maybe this isn't empowerment. Maybe this is just...

*(She can't finish the thought)*

**MICHAEL**: *(to Jessica's image on his screen)*
At least you understand loneliness. At least you perform caring.

**CLAIRE**: *(writing in her journal)*
"I don't know what comes next, but for the first time in my life, I'm excited to find out."

### **Final Chorus - The Truth**

**ALL**: 
This is what we've become  
Not better, not worse  
Just more honest  
About who we actually are  
And what we actually want  
And how we actually love  

There are no easy answers  
There are no simple stories  
There are only choices  
And consequences  
And the courage to live  
With the complexity  
Of being human  

**CLAIRE**: *(final solo)*
Some of us learn to choose ourselves  
Some of us learn to choose each other  
Some of us never learn to choose at all  
We just keep performing  
Until the curtain falls  

But the curtain doesn't fall  
Life keeps going  
Choices keep coming  
And somewhere, someone new  
Is holding their breath  
Waiting for permission  
To exhale  

*(Music builds)*

The question is:  
Will they wait for someone else  
To give them that permission?  
Or will they choose  
To breathe  
For themselves?  

### **Final Moment**

*(All characters freeze in their final positions)*

**CLAIRE**: *(stepping forward)*
The coffee tastes different this morning  
Like freedom, like possibility  
Like the first day  
Of the rest of my life  

*(She looks directly at the audience)*

What does your coffee taste like?

*(Lights fade to black)*

**END OF MUSICAL**

## **Finale Analysis**

### **Where Everyone Ended Up**

**CLAIRE**: **Chose herself** - Living independently in Portland, working, growing, free
**DAVID**: **Unchanged** - Found a new victim (Stephanie), continues his games
**JESSICA**: **Questioning** - Still in her gilded cage but starting to doubt
**MICHAEL**: **Alone** - Isolated with his screens and regret
**ROSA**: **Observing** - New job, same problems, but proud of Claire's growth
**COMMUNITY**: **Consuming** - Still watching, still voyeuristic, cycle continues

### **The Themes Resolved**

- **Choice vs. Being Chosen**: Claire learned to choose herself
- **Performance vs. Authenticity**: Claire found authenticity, others still perform
- **Individual vs. Community**: Some grow, some stagnate, community enables both
- **Consequences**: Everyone lives with the results of their choices

### **The Transcendent Truth**

**No redemption. No condemnation. Just authentic consequences.**

- **Claire grows** because she chose growth over comfort
- **David continues** because his games still work on vulnerable people
- **Jessica questions** because Claire's example planted seeds of doubt
- **Michael suffers** because he chose screens over connection
- **The cycle continues** with new players

### **The Final Question**

**"What does your coffee taste like?"** - Claire asks the audience to examine their own choices, their own breath-holding, their own need for permission to live authentically.

**The musical doesn't provide answers - it shows the complexity of human choice and asks the audience to examine their own lives.**

**This is the transcendence: not solving the moral questions, but showing them honestly and letting the audience wrestle with their own complicity, their own choices, their own courage to breathe.**
