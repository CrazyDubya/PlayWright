## **SCENE 5 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Morning After**
*(Lights up on Claire's kitchen at dawn. CLAIRE sits at the table with coffee, still wearing yesterday's clothes. She looks different - not broken, but thoughtful. Decisive. She's holding David's business card and her wedding ring.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
Twenty-four hours ago, I thought I had to choose between Michael and David. Between safety and danger. Between being invisible and being seen.

*(She looks at both objects)*

But that's not the choice at all, is it?

*(MICHAEL enters, on his phone as usual)*

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up)*
Morning, babe. Coffee ready?

**CLAIRE**: *(studying him)*
Michael, look at me.

**MICHAEL**: *(still scrolling)*
Mm-hmm. Just give me a sec, this email...

**CLAIRE**: *(louder)*
Michael. Look. At. Me.

**MICHAEL**: *(finally looking up, irritated)*
What? I'm trying to work here.

**CLAIRE**: *(calmly)*
When was the last time you really looked at me?

**MICHAEL**: 
What kind of question is that? I look at you every day.

**CLAIRE**: 
No, you look through me. You look past me. You look at your phone while I'm talking. But when did you last actually see me?

**MICHAEL**: *(defensive)*
Claire, what's this about? Are you having some kind of midlife crisis?

**CLAIRE**: *(small smile)*
Yes, Michael. I am. And it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

*(MICHAEL's phone buzzes. He automatically reaches for it)*

**CLAIRE**: 
Don't.

**MICHAEL**: *(stopping)*
What?

**CLAIRE**: 
Don't look at your phone. Look at me. For thirty seconds. Just... see me.

*(MICHAEL reluctantly puts his phone down and looks at her)*

**MICHAEL**: *(after a pause)*
You look... different.

**CLAIRE**: 
I am different. The question is - do you want to know who I'm becoming, or do you want to keep living with who I used to be?

**MICHAEL**: *(uncomfortable)*
I... I don't understand what you're asking.

**CLAIRE**: *(sadly)*
I know you don't. And that's the problem.

*(MICHAEL's phone buzzes again. He looks at it longingly)*

**CLAIRE**: 
Go ahead. Answer it.

**MICHAEL**: *(relieved)*
Thanks, babe. This is important.

*(He answers the phone and exits, already absorbed in the call)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
And that's my answer.

### **Rosa's Entrance**
*(ROSA enters with cleaning supplies)*

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
Buenos días, Señora Claire.

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa. I was hoping you'd come today.

**ROSA**: *(studying her)*
You look like a woman who's made a decision.

**CLAIRE**: 
I have. Several, actually.

**ROSA**: *(starting to clean)*
And what decisions are those?

**CLAIRE**: 
I'm leaving Michael.

**ROSA**: *(not surprised)*
And Señor David?

**CLAIRE**: 
I'm leaving him too.

**ROSA**: *(pausing her cleaning)*
Ah. Now that is interesting.

### **Memory Sequence - Claire's Journey**
*(Memory spaces light up showing key moments)*

**MEMORY - DAVID**: *(from their first meeting)*
"You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time."

**MEMORY - CLAIRE**: *(from the block party)*
"No panties tomorrow... What else?"

**MEMORY - JESSICA**: *(from last night)*
"I found myself here... in this place where I belong."

**MEMORY - DAVID**: *(from last night)*
"You're both here for the same reason. You both need to be chosen."

*(Memories fade)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to Rosa)*
He was right, you know. David. I did need to be chosen. But I was looking for someone else to choose me instead of choosing myself.

**ROSA**: 
And now?

**CLAIRE**: 
Now I'm choosing me.

### **SONG: "WHAT WE CHOOSE" (Claire & Rosa Duet)**

**ROSA**: 
Six months later, here we are  
You in pieces, me still cleaning  
Was it worth it, your falling star?  
All this mess you've been creating?  

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa, please, just let me explain...  

**ROSA**: 
Explain what, Señora? The pain  
You caused your husband, your family?  
The choices that set you free?  

**CLAIRE**: 
You think I'm selfish, I know you do  
But I was dying in that perfect life  
You think I should have just pushed through  
Twenty more years as Michael's wife  

**ROSA**: 
I think you had options you didn't try  
Counseling, talking, working it out  
Instead you chose to live a lie  
While your marriage fell apart  

**CLAIRE**: 
But what if talking couldn't fix  
What was broken from the start?  
What if some problems can't be mixed  
With compromise and hopeful heart?  

**ROSA**: 
Then you leave with dignity  
Not sneak around with other men  
You face the truth honestly  
Not pretend and play pretend  

### **The Core Disagreement**

**ROSA**: 
What we choose defines who we are  
Not what we feel or what we want  
**CLAIRE**: 
What we choose should heal our scars  
Not just do what others want  

**ROSA**: 
Choices have consequences, mija  
**CLAIRE**: 
So does never choosing at all  
**ROSA**: 
You can't just think of yourself  
**CLAIRE**: 
I spent twenty years thinking of everyone else  

**BOTH**: 
What we choose, what we choose  
Shows the world what we value most  
**ROSA**: 
Responsibility  
**CLAIRE**: 
Authenticity  
**BOTH**: 
What we choose  

### **Finding Common Ground**

**ROSA**: *(softer)*
I know about dying inside, Señora  
When my husband passed away  
I wanted to give up, to run away  
But I had children to feed  

**CLAIRE**: *(understanding)*
And I know about responsibility  
I raised two daughters, built a home  
But when they left, I was alone  
With a stranger I called husband  

**ROSA**: 
So we both know sacrifice  

**CLAIRE**: 
And we both know the price  
Of putting others first  

**ROSA**: 
But maybe there's a way  
To honor both our truths  

**CLAIRE**: 
Maybe there's a way  
To choose without destroying  

### **Claire's Declaration**

**CLAIRE**: *(building power)*
I'm not choosing Michael's safety  
I'm not choosing David's danger  
I'm choosing to be a woman  
Who doesn't need a stranger  

Or a husband or a master  
To tell her who she is  
I'm choosing to discover  
What my own voice says  

**ROSA**: 
And what does it say, Señora?  

**CLAIRE**: 
It says I'm enough  
Just as I am  
It says I don't need  
Any man  

To validate my existence  
To give my life meaning  
I can choose my own path  
Without leaning  

On someone else's strength  
Someone else's vision  
I can make my own choice  
My own decision  

### **Final Resolution**

**ROSA**: 
What we choose defines who we are  
**CLAIRE**: 
What we choose should honor our truth  
**ROSA**: 
Choices have consequences  
**CLAIRE**: 
So does living without choice  

**BOTH**: 
What we choose, what we choose  
Shows the world what we believe  
Some choose safety  
Some choose growth  
Some choose to stay  
Some choose to leave  

**ROSA**: 
I choose to work and provide  
**CLAIRE**: 
I choose to feel and explore  
**ROSA**: 
I choose my family's pride  
**CLAIRE**: 
I choose to not ignore  
**BOTH**: 
The voice inside that says  
There has to be something more  

### **The Goodbye**

**ROSA**: *(packing her supplies)*
I won't be coming back, Señora  
Not because I hate you  
But because I can't watch you  
Destroy what I can't have  

**CLAIRE**: 
Actually, Rosa... I won't be here either.

**ROSA**: *(surprised)*
¿Cómo?

**CLAIRE**: 
I'm leaving. Today. I'm going to stay with my sister in Portland while I figure out what comes next.

**ROSA**: *(studying her)*
And Señor David?

**CLAIRE**: 
I told him last night. He said he'd wait for me to come to my senses.

**ROSA**: 
And will you?

**CLAIRE**: *(smiling)*
I already have. Just not the way he expected.

**ROSA**: *(small smile)*
And your husband?

**CLAIRE**: 
Michael will probably notice I'm gone sometime next week.

*(They both laugh)*

**ROSA**: 
You know what, Señora Claire? I think you're going to be just fine.

**CLAIRE**: 
I think so too. For the first time in my life, I think so too.

### **Final Moment**

**ROSA**: *(at the door)*
Take care of yourself, Claire  
And maybe... learn to cook  
You're going to need it  

**CLAIRE**: *(laughing)*
Maybe I will  

**ROSA**: 
And Claire? Next time you choose...  
Choose with your eyes open  
Not just your heart  

**CLAIRE**: 
I will. I promise.  

*(ROSA exits. CLAIRE stands alone in her kitchen)*

**CLAIRE**: *(final lines)*
What we choose...  
What we choose...  

*(She picks up her suitcase)*

I choose me.

*(Lights fade as she exits)*

## **Scene Analysis**

### **What This Scene Accomplishes**
1. **Claire's final choice** - Chooses herself over both men
2. **Michael's continued obliviousness** - Still choosing phone over wife
3. **Rosa and Claire's resolution** - Mutual respect despite disagreement
4. **Character growth** - Claire becomes self-determined, not other-determined
5. **Setup for finale** - Claire leaves to discover who she is alone

### **Character Development**
- **Claire**: Completes her arc from empty to authentic to self-determined
- **Rosa**: Maintains her moral clarity while respecting Claire's choice
- **Michael**: Remains unchanged, choosing digital over real connection

### **The Choice Explained**
- **Not between two men** - between being chosen and choosing herself
- **Not between safety and danger** - between performance and authenticity
- **Not between good and bad** - between other-determined and self-determined

### **The Duet's Power**
- **"What We Choose"** shows two different but valid approaches to life
- **Rosa chooses responsibility** - family, sacrifice, stability
- **Claire chooses authenticity** - growth, risk, self-discovery
- **Both are valid** - the musical doesn't pick sides

### **Setup for Finale**
- **Claire leaves** to discover herself independently
- **Rosa's respect** for Claire's choice despite disagreement
- **Michael's obliviousness** continues unchanged
- **David's expectation** that she'll "come to her senses"

**This scene completes Claire's transformation from a woman seeking to be chosen to a woman choosing herself - the ultimate act of empowerment.**
