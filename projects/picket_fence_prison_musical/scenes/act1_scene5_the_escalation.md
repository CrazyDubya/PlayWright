## **SCENE 5 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Setup**
*(Lights up on a realistic supermarket. CLAIRE enters with confidence, wearing the blue dress David requested. She moves differently - aware of her body, purposeful.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(checking her phone)*
"Aisle 7, wine section, 3:15. Wear the blue dress and remember - you're beautiful when you stop apologizing for existing."

*(She smiles, touching the fabric of her dress)*

I haven't felt beautiful in... God, I can't remember how long.

*(JESSICA enters from the opposite side, clearly having prepared for this encounter - more makeup, tighter clothes, phone ready for content)*

**JESSICA**: *(to her phone camera, whispering)*
"Okay, beautiful souls, I'm about to do something that might seem crazy, but sometimes you have to fight for what you want. Sometimes you have to show someone your dedication in public."

*(She spots CLAIRE)*

Perfect. She's here too.

### **David's Entrance**
*(DAVID enters, immediately commanding the space without trying. Both women notice him)*

**DAVID**: *(approaching Claire first)*
Claire. You look radiant.

**CLAIRE**: *(blushing)*
Thank you. I... I did what you asked.

**DAVID**: *(low voice)*
I know. I can tell by the way you're carrying yourself. Confidence looks beautiful on you.

*(JESSICA approaches, interrupting)*

**JESSICA**: *(bright, performative)*
David! What a coincidence seeing you here. I was just telling my followers about the importance of... authentic encounters.

**DAVID**: *(studying both women)*
Jessica. How... convenient.

*(He steps back, observing)*

Ladies, I have a proposition. I'm hosting a small gathering tonight. Both of you are invited.

**CLAIRE**: *(surprised)*
Both of us?

**JESSICA**: *(excited)*
I'd love to come! What kind of gathering?

**DAVID**: *(smiling)*
The kind where we explore what people are really willing to do for what they want.

### **SONG: "SUPERMARKET SEDUCTION" (Full Company)**

### **Opening - Ensemble**
*(Suburban shoppers going about their routine)*

**ENSEMBLE**: *(overlapping, creating rhythm)*
Organic produce, gluten-free bread  
Soccer practice, kids to be fed  
Coupon clipping, budget tight  
Another ordinary Tuesday night  

Shopping lists and meal prep plans  
Minivans and wedding bands  
Everything is as it seems  
In our suburban shopping dreams  

### **Verse 1 - Claire**
*(Moving through the store with new confidence)*

**CLAIRE**: 
David's text came in at three  
"Show them all what you can be  
When you stop hiding who you are  
Let them see your rising star"  

*(She moves sensually through the produce section)*

No apologies, just grace  
Taking up my rightful space  
Every step a declaration  
This is my emancipation  

### **Verse 1 - Jessica**
*(More desperate, trying to outdo Claire)*

**JESSICA**: 
Got my camera, got my plan  
Show him I'm his biggest fan  
"Day sixteen, part two, my loves  
Watch me rise above, above"  

*(Moving provocatively, aware of being filmed)*

Every move calculated  
Every pose anticipated  
This is content, this is art  
This is me playing my part  

### **Pre-Chorus - Both**
*(They notice each other across the store)*

**CLAIRE**: Wait, is that...?  
**JESSICA**: Oh my God...  
**BOTH**: What is she doing here?  
**CLAIRE**: This is my moment  
**JESSICA**: This is my content  
**BOTH**: Something isn't right, I fear  

### **Chorus - Competition Begins**
*(Music builds as they start competing)*

**CLAIRE**: Watch me move through frozen foods  
**JESSICA**: See me break suburban rules  
**BOTH**: Every eye upon us now  
**CLAIRE**: I'll show them how  
**JESSICA**: I'll show them how  
**BOTH**: To make a simple shopping trip  
Into something they can't skip  

**ENSEMBLE**: *(confused but intrigued)*
Something's different in the air  
Something's happening over there  
Why are they moving like that?  
What's beneath this normal chat?  

### **Verse 2 - The Escalation**
*(CLAIRE in wine section, JESSICA in produce)*

**CLAIRE**: *(reaching for wine, letting her dress ride up)*
Choosing wine like choosing life  
No longer just Michael's wife  
David said to let them see  
The woman I'm learning to be  

**JESSICA**: *(bending over melons, filming herself)*
"Testing fruit for ripeness, loves  
Sometimes you need gentle shoves  
To know what's ready, what's not  
What's cold and what's hot"  

*(MICHAEL appears, secretly filming Jessica)*

**MICHAEL**: *(to himself)*
This is incredible. She's so... uninhibited. So real.

*(He doesn't notice CLAIRE's transformation happening nearby)*

### **Bridge - The Collision**
*(They end up in the same aisle)*

**CLAIRE**: *(suspicious)*
Funny how we both got here  

**JESSICA**: *(defensive)*
Just shopping, nothing weird  

**CLAIRE**: *(checking her phone)*
David said to meet him at...  

**JESSICA**: *(checking hers)*
David said... oh shit  

**BOTH**: *(realization dawning)*
David...  
David...  
DAVID!  

*(DAVID appears at the end of the aisle)*

**DAVID**: *(amused)*
Ladies. Having fun?

### **Ensemble Interlude**
*(The shoppers start to notice the tension)*

**SHOPPER 1**: Are they having some kind of fight?  
**SHOPPER 2**: Over what? They're both so pretty  
**SHOPPER 3**: Something's not quite right  
**ROSA**: *(appearing with her cart)*
Ay, Dios mío. Rich people problems in aisle five.

**ENSEMBLE**: 
In our safe suburban bubble  
Nothing's supposed to cause trouble  
But these women seem to be  
Fighting over something we can't see  

### **Final Chorus - Full Competition**
*(Both women going all out)*

**CLAIRE**: I was here first, this is my journey  
**JESSICA**: Honey, this is my attorney  
**BOTH**: David chose me, David wants me  
**CLAIRE**: I'm the one he came to see  
**JESSICA**: I'm the one he came to free  
**BOTH**: From this suburban prison  

**ENSEMBLE**: *(building excitement)*
Something's happening in our store  
Something we've not seen before  
These perfect wives are coming alive  
Right here in aisle five!  

### **Climax - The Challenge**
*(Music reaches peak intensity)*

**JESSICA**: *(bold)*
You think you know what David wants?  

**CLAIRE**: *(matching her)*
I know exactly what he wants  

**JESSICA**: Then prove it  

**CLAIRE**: How?  

**JESSICA**: Right here, right now  
Show everyone who wears the crown  

**DAVID**: *(stepping forward)*
Enough.

*(Music stops abruptly)*

Both of you. My house. Eight o'clock tonight.

**CLAIRE**: *(confused)*
Both of us?

**DAVID**: 
Both of you. We're going to settle this properly.

**JESSICA**: *(excited)*
What kind of settling?

**DAVID**: *(smiling)*
The kind where everyone gets what they think they want.

### **Rosa's Intervention**
*(ROSA approaches with her cart)*

**ROSA**: *(to Claire)*
Señora Claire, you forgot your shopping list.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
I... I don't have a shopping list.

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
Exactly. You came here for something else entirely.

*(She looks at both women)*

Both of you did. Question is - are you sure you want to find it?

**JESSICA**: *(defensive)*
We're just... exploring our authentic selves.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
In the produce section. Very authentic.

*(She turns to DAVID)*

And you, Señor. You're enjoying this show?

**DAVID**: *(surprised by her directness)*
I'm sorry?

**ROSA**: 
Two women fighting over you in public. Very flattering, no?

**DAVID**: *(uncomfortable)*
I don't know what you mean.

**ROSA**: *(shrugging)*
Of course not. Men never do.

*(She pushes her cart away)*

Eight o'clock, you said? I'll make sure to be gone by then.

### **The Aftermath**
*(The crowd disperses, leaving the three main characters)*

**DAVID**: *(to both women)*
Tonight, we explore what you're both really looking for. But I warn you - you might not like what you find.

**CLAIRE**: *(nervous but determined)*
I'll be there.

**JESSICA**: *(desperate)*
Me too. Whatever it takes.

**DAVID**: 
Good. Wear something... comfortable. You'll be there for a while.

*(He exits, leaving both women staring after him)*

**MICHAEL**: *(approaching Jessica, still filming)*
That was... intense. Are you okay?

**JESSICA**: *(not looking at him)*
I'm perfect, Robert. Absolutely perfect.

**MICHAEL**: *(confused)*
I'm Michael. Robert's your husband.

**JESSICA**: *(realizing)*
Right. Sorry. I'm just... focused on tonight.

*(She exits, leaving MICHAEL confused)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
Eight o'clock. Both of us.

*(She looks around the supermarket)*

What have I gotten myself into?

*(Lights fade as she exits)*
