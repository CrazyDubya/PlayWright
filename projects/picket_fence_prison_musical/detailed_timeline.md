## **DAVID'S RELATIONSHIP WITH JESSICA - THE MANIPULATION**

- He feeds her ideas about submission and power exchange

### **The Exposure Strategy**
- David deliberately creates competition between Claire and Jessica

- The supermarket scene is orchestrated - he sends both women there simultaneously
- He uses Jessica's exhibitionism to make Claire feel special and "chosen"

### **The Purpose**
- Jessica serves as a cautionary tale for Claire
- Her public performance makes Claire's private journey feel more authentic
- David uses Jessica's desperation to show Claire what "fake" submission looks like
- Jessica becomes the "bad example" that makes Claire feel superior
