- **Physical Description**: Petite, perfectly groomed, designer everything - uses appearance as armor and weapon. Dark hair always styled, makeup always perfect, clothing that suggests wealth and control

## Character Arc

### **Want vs. Need**
- **Want**: To win David's exclusive attention and prove she's the better submissive
- **Need**: To stop seeking validation through competition and find her own worth independent of male approval
- **Hidden Want**: To be accepted and loved for who she really is, not who she performs being

### **Fatal Flaw**
Competitive nature that turns everything into a contest she must win. She can't enjoy anything unless she's beating someone else at it, which prevents her from forming genuine connections.

- **Resolution**: Learning to value herself without needing to diminish others

## Background & Trauma

### **Family Secret**
Jessica was sexually abused by her adoptive father from ages 12-16. Her adoptive mother knew but chose to protect the family's reputation rather than Jessica. She uses BDSM as a way to reclaim control over her trauma, but hasn't processed the underlying pain.

### **Adoption Trauma**
Adopted from Korea at age 3 by a white evangelical family who wanted to "save" her. She's spent her life trying to be the perfect daughter/wife/Christian to prove she was worth saving. The cultural disconnection and pressure to be grateful has left her with deep identity issues.

### **Economic Pressure**
Real estate agent in a competitive market, dependent on maintaining perfect image and connections. Her income fluctuates wildly, but she maintains expensive lifestyle through credit and her husband's income. The financial stress adds to her need to win at everything.

## Relationships

### **With David (Dom)**
- Represents validation and power she's never had
- She mistakes his control for the love and acceptance she craves
- Their dynamic is less healthy than his relationship with Claire - more about competition than growth
- She's willing to do increasingly dangerous things to maintain his attention

### **With Claire (Rival/Friend)**
- Initially sees Claire as competition for David's attention
- Gradually realizes they're both being manipulated by the same man
- Their rivalry could become genuine friendship if they can move past competition
- Represents the sister/friend Jessica has never allowed herself to have

### **With Robert (Husband)**
- Married him because he was safe and provided security
- He's a good man but doesn't understand her needs or trauma
- She performs the role of perfect Christian wife while hiding her true self
- Their marriage is built on her performance, not authentic connection

### **With Her Adoptive Family**
- Still trying to prove she was worth adopting
- Maintains contact but feels like an outsider
- They see her success as validation of their "rescue" of her
- She's never told them about the abuse or her real struggles

## Contradictions & Complexity

### **Perfect Christian vs. Sexual Submissive**
- **Public**: Model Christian wife, active in church, volunteers for mission work
- **Private**: Craves sexual submission and power exchange
- **Conflict**: How can she reconcile her faith with her desires?

### **Success vs. Insecurity**
- **Surface**: Successful businesswoman with perfect life
- **Reality**: Constantly terrified of failure and abandonment
- **Behavior**: Overachieves to mask deep feelings of unworthiness

### **Competition vs. Connection**
- **Pattern**: Turns every relationship into a competition
- **Desire**: Actually wants genuine connection and friendship
- **Fear**: If she's not winning, she's losing, and losing means abandonment

## Key Scenes & Songs

*Sample lyrics:*
```
I've been fighting you for scraps
Of a man who set the traps
We've been dancing to his tune
While he watches us consume
Each other for his pleasure
We're both just his treasure
To be played against each other
Sister, we should be like mother
And daughter, not like rivals
Fighting for our survivals
```

## Character Voice & Dialogue

### **Speech Patterns**
- Speaks quickly when nervous or competitive
- Uses business/sales language even in personal situations
- Korean phrases emerge when she's extremely emotional (learned from birth mother)
- Perfectionist language - everything is "amazing" or "perfect" or "the best"

### **Competitive Mode**

- Uses backhanded compliments and subtle put-downs
- Body language becomes more aggressive and territorial
- Smiles that don't reach her eyes

### **Vulnerable Moments**

- Reverts to seeking approval and validation
- Physical posture becomes more closed and protective
- Authentic emotion breaks through the performance

## Costume & Visual Design

### **Daily Wear**
- Designer everything but slightly trying too hard
- Colors that suggest perfection: whites, pastels, metallics
- Always perfectly coordinated and styled
- Clothing that suggests wealth but also insecurity

### **Competition Scenes**
- More overtly sexy than Claire's subtle sensuality
- Clothing that's designed to be noticed and envied
- Colors that suggest aggression: reds, blacks, bold patterns
- Accessories that hint at her submissive side

### **Vulnerable Moments**
- Clothing becomes less perfect, more human
- Colors soften to show her emotional state
- Physical styling becomes less controlled

## Musical Considerations

### **Vocal Range**
- Soprano, C4 to C6 with strong upper register

### **Musical Themes**
- **Competition motif**: Sharp, staccato rhythms
- **Insecurity theme**: Uncertain, searching melodic lines
- **Adoption trauma**: Minor key passages with Asian musical influences
- **Growth music**: Harmonies that blend with Claire's voice

## Actor Requirements

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

### **Sexual Abuse Survivor**
- Consult with trauma specialists about authentic representation

## The Moral Complexity

Jessica is not a villain - she's a woman whose trauma and cultural displacement have created patterns of competition and performance that prevent genuine connection. Her rivalry with Claire comes from a place of deep insecurity and fear of abandonment.

Her journey is about learning that she doesn't have to win to be worthy of love, that she can be valued for who she is rather than what she achieves or how perfectly she performs.

The audience should understand that her competitive behavior comes from survival instincts developed in childhood, not from inherent meanness or selfishness.

### **Key Questions for the Actor**
- How does Jessica's adoption trauma affect her need to be "the best"?
- What does she see in David that she's never gotten from other men?
- How does her faith complicate her sexual desires?
- What would it mean for her to stop competing with other women?
- How does her cultural disconnection affect her sense of identity?

3. **Recognition**: Realizing she's being manipulated and used
