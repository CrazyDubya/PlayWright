# ACT I, SCENE 3: "INTERMISSION"
## Vivian's Dressing Room - 9:45 PM

*The audience has been dismissed for an "extended intermission due to technical difficulties." Backstage, the chaos continues. VIVIAN's dressing room is her sanctuary - photos from twenty-seven years of Broadway, flowers from admirers, and a locked trunk in the corner.*

*VIVIAN sits at her vanity, removing her stage makeup with shaking hands. The pill bottle from earlier sits open beside her. She's talking to herself in Czech.*

**VIVIAN**: (In Czech, then English)
*Věra Svoboda... Věra Svoboda...*
That's who I was. Before I became this... this thing they made me.
(To her reflection)
Twenty-seven years of their secrets, Věra. Twenty-seven years of being their confessor, their whore, their keeper of sins.

*She opens the locked trunk. Inside: photographs, letters, documents. Evidence.*

**VIVIAN**: (Pulling out photographs)
Senator Morrison with his "nephew." 
(Another photo)
Judge Blackwood at the "charity event."
(Another)
Commissioner Chen taking his "consulting fee."

*A knock at the door*

**VIVIAN**: (Quickly closing trunk)
Go away! I'm not seeing anyone!

**VOICE**: (Muffled through door)
Vivian, it's me. We need to talk.

**VIVIAN**: (Recognizing the voice, bitter laugh)
Of course it's you. I should have known you'd come first.

*She opens the door. We don't see who enters - the camera stays on VIVIAN's face*

**VIVIAN**: (Stepping back)
So. How long have you been planning this?

**VISITOR**: (Voice still off-camera)
Planning what? I came to check on you. That performance... what were you thinking?

**VIVIAN**: (Pouring herself a drink with steady hands now)
I was thinking it's time for the truth. All of it.
(Turning to face visitor)
Starting with you.

**VISITOR**: 
Vivian, you're not well. Those pills—

**VIVIAN**: (Interrupting)
The pills YOU arranged for me to get? The ones that were supposed to keep me quiet? Keep me manageable?
(Laughing)
Did you really think I was taking them?

*She opens the pill bottle, dumps the contents. They're not pills - they're small rolled papers.*

**VIVIAN**: (Unrolling one)
Names. Dates. Bank account numbers. Everything you thought I'd forgotten.
(Reading)
"March 15th, 1949. Payment to V.S. for services rendered. Silence regarding the Kowalski matter."

**VISITOR**: (Voice changing, becoming dangerous)
Where did you get that?

**VIVIAN**: (Triumphant)
I've been documenting everything for years. Every payoff, every threat, every time you made me clean up your messes.
(Moving to the trunk)
And it's all here. All of it.

**VISITOR**: 
Vivian, be reasonable. We can work this out. We always have.

**VIVIAN**: (Pulling out more documents)
Work it out? Like we worked out the Kowalski girl? Like we worked out the Chen boy? Like we worked out all the others who got too close to the truth?

**VISITOR**: 
Those were different times. Different circumstances.

**VIVIAN**: (Whirling around)
Different? DIFFERENT? You destroyed families! You destroyed lives! And you made me watch! You made me HELP!

*She's building to hysteria again*

**VIVIAN**: (Continuing)
Ruby doesn't know, does she? That her mother didn't abandon her? That her mother was MURDERED because she found out about your little arrangement with the immigration officials?

**VISITOR**: (Long pause)
How long have you known?

**VIVIAN**: (Coldly)
Since the day I hired her. Poor little Róża Kowalski. So talented. So trusting. So much like her mother.

**VISITOR**: 
What do you want?

**VIVIAN**: (Moving to her vanity, opening a drawer)
What do I want? I want to stop being your accomplice. I want to stop being your whore. I want to tell the truth.
(Pulling out an envelope)
This goes to the Times tomorrow morning. Everything. Names, dates, photographs, bank records.

**VISITOR**: 
You can't do that.

**VIVIAN**: (Sealing the envelope)
Watch me.

*Sound of footsteps. The VISITOR is moving closer.*

**VIVIAN**: (Not turning around)
What are you going to do? Kill me? Here? Tonight? With a theater full of witnesses?

**VISITOR**: 
If I have to.

**VIVIAN**: (Finally turning, and we see her face - she's not afraid anymore, she's relieved)
Good. I'm tired of living with what we've done. I'm tired of being afraid. I'm tired of keeping your secrets.

*She moves toward the door*

**VIVIAN**: (Continuing)
I'm going to give this to Detective Morrison. Right now. And then I'm going to tell him everything.

**VISITOR**: 
Vivian, don't.

*VIVIAN reaches for the door handle. The VISITOR grabs her arm.*

**VIVIAN**: (Struggling)
Let me go! LET ME GO!

**VISITOR**: 
I can't let you destroy everything. Too many people will get hurt.

**VIVIAN**: (Fighting harder)
People are ALREADY hurt! People are DEAD because of us!

*The struggle intensifies. VIVIAN breaks free, runs toward the vanity*

**VIVIAN**: (Grabbing something from the drawer)
Stay back! I'll scream! I'll—

*The VISITOR lunges. There's a crash. VIVIAN falls, hitting her head on the corner of the vanity. Blood.*

**VISITOR**: (Kneeling beside her)
Vivian? Vivian!

*VIVIAN is still conscious, but fading*

**VIVIAN**: (Weakly)
The envelope... the trunk... Ruby... tell Ruby...

**VISITOR**: 
Tell her what?

**VIVIAN**: (With her last breath)
Tell her... her mother... loved her...

*She dies. The VISITOR stands, looking at the body, then at the envelope. Picks it up.*

**VISITOR**: (To the corpse)
I'm sorry, Vivian. I'm so sorry.

*Sound of footsteps in the hallway. The VISITOR quickly pockets the envelope, looks around the room, then moves to the window - there's a fire escape.*

**MAGGIE**: (Voice from hallway)
Vivian? Vivian, the police want to talk to you!

*The VISITOR climbs out the window just as MAGGIE knocks on the door*

**MAGGIE**: (Knocking harder)
Vivian? I'm coming in!

*MAGGIE enters, sees the body, drops her clipboard*

**MAGGIE**: (In Taishanese, then English)
*Aiya! Sei jo la!* 
(Screaming)
HELP! SOMEBODY HELP! SHE'S DEAD! VIVIAN'S DEAD!

*Chaos erupts. FRANK, RUBY, TOMMY, JONATHAN, HELENA, and EDDIE all rush in*

**FRANK**: (Taking charge)
Nobody touch anything! This is a crime scene!
(To Maggie)
When did you find her?

**MAGGIE**: (Shaking)
Just now! I came to get her for the police interview and—

**RUBY**: (Seeing the body, collapsing)
*Boże mój!* No... no, no, no...

**TOMMY**: (Catching Ruby)
Easy, Ruby. Easy.

**JONATHAN**: (Staring at the body)
*Mein Gott...* This can't be happening.

**HELENA**: (Examining the scene with professional detachment)
The window's open. Someone could have escaped that way.

**EDDIE**: (Hyperventilating)
We're ruined! We're all ruined! The investors! The critics! My daughter's college fund!

**FRANK**: (Studying the room)
The struggle started here, by the door. She ran to the vanity, fell, hit her head.
(Looking around)
But something's missing.

**RUBY**: (Through tears)
What?

**FRANK**: (Checking the vanity drawer)
She was holding something when she died. An envelope, maybe. It's gone.

*Everyone looks at each other. The killer is in this room.*

**FRANK**: (Standing)
Nobody leaves this theater. Nobody. We're going to find out who killed Vivian Sterling, and we're going to find out tonight.

*He looks at each suspect in turn*

**FRANK**: (Continuing)
Because one of you... is a murderer.

*Thunder crashes outside. The lights flicker.*

**MAGGIE**: (Whispered)
*Gwai.*
(In English)
Ghost.

*Lights fade to black*

**END OF ACT I**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

**THE MURDER DELIVERED:**

1. **NOT PREMEDITATED**: The killer came to reason with Vivian, not to murder her
2. **MORAL COMPLEXITY**: The death was accidental during a struggle, making the killer sympathetic
3. **EVIDENCE STOLEN**: The envelope containing the truth is now in the killer's possession
4. **REVELATION ABOUT RUBY**: Her mother was murdered, she doesn't know
5. **MULTIPLE MOTIVES**: Everyone had reason to want Vivian silenced
6. **AUTHENTIC CULTURAL VOICES**: Each character reacts according to their background
7. **REAL STAKES**: This isn't just about solving a murder - it's about exposing decades of corruption

**THE KILLER'S IDENTITY**: Deliberately obscured but clues are planted. The audience knows the killer is one of our main characters, but which one?

**NEW ENTROPY**: We've gone from "opening night nerves" to "accidental murder during struggle over evidence of decades-long conspiracy."

**THE TRANSCENDENT ELEMENT**: Vivian's death isn't just plot device - it's the inevitable result of a woman who finally chose truth over survival, and it cost her everything.

Act II will be the investigation, but now it's not just "whodunit" - it's "who was desperate enough to kill to keep their secrets safe?"
