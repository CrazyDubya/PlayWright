## Act I, Song 5 - Vivian's Ghost/Memory Song (Act I Finale)

## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE CONFESSION (Vivian alone, ethereal)**

**VIVIAN** (Czech folk melody, minor key, haunting):
*In Czech, then English*
*Věra Svoboda died in 1925*
*Vivian Sterling was born from her ashes*
*I built this name*
*This face*
*This life*
*To save the ones*
*Who couldn't save themselves*

*For twenty-seven years*
*I kept their secrets*
*Forged their papers*
*Bought their freedom*
*With my body*
*With my soul*
*With everything*
*I had to give*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE BURDEN**

**VIVIAN** (Building, but still ethereal):
*What I couldn't tell you*
*Would have destroyed you*
*What I couldn't show you*
*Would have killed you*
*So I carried the weight*
*Of all your sins*
*All your fears*
*All your desperate choices*
*Alone*

*I was your mother*
*Your confessor*
*Your savior*
*Your whore*
*Whatever you needed*
*To survive*
*Another day*

### **VERSE 2 - THE NETWORK REVEALED**

**VIVIAN** (Moving through the frozen suspects):
*Ruby, my little bird*
*I couldn't tell you*
*Your mother was coming*
*Coming to take you home*
*But home meant danger*
*Home meant death*
*So I let you hate me*
*Instead*

*Tommy, sweet boy*
*I couldn't tell you*
*They were watching*
*Waiting for you*
*To make one mistake*
*One slip*
*One moment*
*Of being yourself*

*Helena, broken queen*
*I couldn't tell you*
*Your daughter survived*
*Lives in Montreal*
*Has children of her own*
*Because telling you*
*Would have meant*
*Exposing the route*
*That saved her*

### **BRIDGE - THE PRICE OF SALVATION**

**VIVIAN** (Voice breaking, but determined):
*Do you know what it costs*
*To save a life?*
*Do you know what it takes*
*To forge a soul?*
*I slept with senators*
*To get you papers*
*I blackmailed judges*
*To clear your names*
*I sold my body*
*My reputation*
*My chance at love*
*To buy your freedom*

*And when the weight*
*Became too much*
*When the secrets*
*Started eating me alive*
*I thought about stopping*
*I thought about telling*
*I thought about*
*Setting us all free*

### **VERSE 3 - THE FINAL TRUTH**

**VIVIAN** (Moving toward Ruby):
*But then she came*
*Your mother, Ruby*
*Katarzyna*
*Alive*
*Desperate*
*Dangerous*

*She wanted to take you*
*Back to the network*
*Make you part*
*Of the operation*
*Use your talent*
*Your beauty*
*Your innocence*
*To save others*

*And I said no*
*I said you deserved*
*A real life*
*A clean life*
*A life without*
*Blood on your hands*

### **CHORUS 2 - THE SACRIFICE**

**VIVIAN** (Full voice, soaring):
*What I couldn't tell you*
*Was that love*
*Sometimes means*
*Letting go*
*What I couldn't show you*
*Was that freedom*
*Has a price*
*Someone has to pay*

*So I paid it*
*With my life*
*With my death*
*With my silence*
*So you could live*
*So you could choose*
*So you could be*
*More than survivors*
*More than refugees*
*More than the sum*
*Of your traumas*

### **VERSE 4 - THE WARNING**

**VIVIAN** (Voice becoming urgent, fading):
*But she's here now*
*Your mother*
*In this theater*
*Tonight*
*And she'll ask you*
*To choose*
*Between safety*
*And family*
*Between freedom*
*And duty*
*Between love*
*And survival*

*And I can't*
*Protect you*
*Anymore*

### **FINAL CHORUS - THE FAREWELL**

**VIVIAN** (Fading, but with love):
*What I couldn't tell you*
*I'm telling you now*
*What I couldn't give you*
*I give you now*
*The truth*
*The choice*
*The chance*
*To be*
*Who you really are*

*Not Ruby Fontaine*
*Not Róża Kowalski*
*But someone*
*Who chooses*
*Love over fear*
*Truth over safety*
*Family over*
*Everything else*

### **OUTRO - THE REVELATION**

**VIVIAN** (Barely audible, as lights fade):
*She's here*
*She's been here*
*All along*
*Watching*
*Waiting*
*Planning*

*Your mother*
*Killed me*
*To save you*
*From the choice*
*I couldn't make*

*But now*
*The choice*
*Is yours*

*Choose wisely*
*My little bird*
*Choose*
*With love*

*(She fades as lights snap back to reality)*
