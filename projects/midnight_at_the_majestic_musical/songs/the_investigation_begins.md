## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE SETUP (Frank, methodical and calm)**

**FRANK** (Irish folk melody, but modern and sharp):
*Twenty years I've walked this beat*
*Twenty years of lies and truth*
*I can smell deception*
*Like smoke in the air*
*And this theater reeks of it*

*So we'll start simple*
*We'll start clean*
*Names and places*
*Times and means*
*And by morning*
*I'll know which one of you*
*Killed Vivian Sterling*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE METHOD**

**FRANK** (Building intensity):
*Question by question*
*Lie by lie*
*I'll strip away*
*Your alibis*
*Piece by piece*
*Truth by truth*
*Until there's nowhere left*
*To hide*

*One of you is a killer*
*One of you crossed that line*
*And I'll find you*
*If it takes all night*
*I'll find you*

### **VERSE 2 - RUBY'S INTERROGATION**

**FRANK** (Moving to Ruby, voice gentler but probing):
*Ruby Fontaine*
*Pretty name*
*American name*
*But that's not what's on your birth certificate*
*Is it, Róża?*

**RUBY** (Defensive, Polish accent emerging):
*I don't know what you mean*
*I was born in Brooklyn*
*I have papers*

**FRANK** (Pressing):
*Forged papers*
*Just like your mother's*
*Katarzyna Kowalski*
*Ring any bells?*

**RUBY** (Breaking):
*My mother is dead*
*She went back to Poland*
*She left me*

**FRANK** (Revelation):
*Your mother was murdered*
*Three years ago*
*East River*
*Throat cut*
*And Vivian Sterling knew*

### **CHORUS 2 - BUILDING PRESSURE**

**FRANK** (More aggressive):
*Question by question*
*Lie by lie*
*Watch your stories*
*Fall apart*
*Piece by piece*
*Truth by truth*
*Until you're naked*
*In the light*

**ENSEMBLE** (Fearful, overlapping):
*He knows too much*
*He sees too much*
*He'll destroy us all*

### **VERSE 3 - TOMMY'S TURN**

**FRANK** (Turning to Tommy):
*Tommaso Giuseppe Rossini*
*Three arrests*
*Public indecency*
*Solicitation*
*But the charges disappeared*
*Someone paid*
*Someone with influence*

**TOMMY** (Panicking):
*I never hurt nobody*
*I just dance*
*I just try to survive*

**FRANK** (Relentless):
*Survive what?*
*The raids?*
*The roundups?*
*The camps they don't talk about*
*For people like you?*

**TOMMY** (Desperate):
*You don't understand*
*They're hunting us*
*People like me*
*We disappear*

**FRANK** (Understanding dawning):
*And Vivian helped you hide*

### **BRIDGE - THE PATTERN EMERGES**

**FRANK** (Realization building):
*Helena Worthington*
*Born Helga Württemberg*
*Fled Germany, 1947*
*Forged papers*

*Jonathan Blackwood*
*Born Yonatan Schwarzberg*
*Family died in the camps*
*New identity*

*Margaret Chen*
*Chen Mei-Ling*
*Mother's marriage is bigamy*
*Deportation hanging*
*Over your head*

*Eduardo Torrino*
*Paying protection*
*Not to the mob*
*But to stay invisible*
*To stay safe*

**FRANK** (The truth hitting):
*Jesus Christ*
*You're all refugees*
*All of you*
*Running from something*
*Hiding from someone*
*And Vivian Sterling*
*Was your lifeline*

### **VERSE 4 - THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD**

**FRANK** (Pieces falling together):
*She wasn't just an actress*
*She was running an operation*
*New identities*
*Safe passage*
*Documents and papers*
*For the desperate*
*For the hunted*
*For the lost*

**ENSEMBLE** (Fearful admission):
*She saved us*
*She protected us*
*She gave us new lives*

**FRANK** (The key question):
*Then why would you kill her?*
*Why bite the hand*
*That fed you?*
*That sheltered you?*
*That kept you alive?*

### **CHORUS 3 - THE CLIMAX**

**FRANK** (Full intensity):
*Question by question*
*Lie by lie*
*The truth is uglier*
*Than I thought*
*Piece by piece*
*Truth by truth*
*You're not just suspects*
*You're survivors*

*But one of you*
*Still crossed that line*
*One of you*
*Still chose murder*
*And I'll find you*
*Even if it breaks*
*Everything you've built*

**ENSEMBLE** (Desperate):
*Don't destroy us*
*Don't expose us*
*We've suffered enough*
*We've lost enough*
*Please*

### **OUTRO - THE CHOICE**

**FRANK** (Quiet, conflicted):
*Twenty years on the force*
*I thought I knew*
*Right from wrong*
*Law from justice*
*But standing here*
*Looking at you*
*I'm not sure*
*I know anything*

*Except that Vivian Sterling*
*Is dead*
*And one of you*
*Killed her*

*And that's a truth*
*I can't ignore*
*No matter how much*
*It might destroy*
