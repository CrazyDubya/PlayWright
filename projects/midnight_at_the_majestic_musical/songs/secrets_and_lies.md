## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - INDIVIDUAL CONFESSIONS (Whispered, overlapping)**

**RUBY** (Polish folk melody, minor key):
*In Polish, then English*
*Matka, gdzie jesteś?* (Mother, where are you?)
*I've been searching for twenty-three years*
*For the woman who left me behind*
*But Vivian knew... Vivian knew*
*And now she's gone*
*And I'm still alone*

**TOMMY** (Italian tarantella rhythm, nervous and quick):
*Papa thinks I'm sick, thinks I'm wrong*
*Says dancing makes me weak*
*But Vivian understood*
*She gave me papers, gave me hope*
*Said I could be who I am*
*Without shame, without fear*
*But what if they find out?*
*What if they send me back?*

**HELENA** (German waltz, but broken and haunting):
*In German, then English*
*Meine Tochter... mein Herz...* (My daughter... my heart...)
*I left her in Berlin*
*I chose myself over her*
*And Vivian knew my shame*
*Knew what I did to survive*
*The names I gave them*
*The families I destroyed*

**JONATHAN** (Hebrew prayer melody, guilt-ridden):
*Baruch Hashem... forgive me*
*I collaborated to save my family*
*But they died anyway*
*And I lived with their blood*
*On my hands, in my dreams*
*Vivian kept my secret*
*But secrets have a price*

**MAGGIE** (Taishanese lullaby, protective and fierce):
*In Taishanese, then English*
*Mama's marriage is a lie*
*We could all be sent away*
*Back to a country that's not home*
*Vivian helped us stay*
*Helped us hide*
*But hiding costs everything*

**EDDIE** (Sicilian folk song, but terrified):
*They think I'm connected*
*Think I'm tough, think I'm wise*
*But I'm just a grocer's son*
*Paying protection to stay alive*
*Vivian knew the truth*
*Knew I was weak*
*Knew I was scared*

### **CHORUS 1 - BUILDING TOGETHER**

**ALL** (Harmonies building, each in their own language first, then English):
*We all have secrets*
*We all have lies*
*We all have reasons*
*To close our eyes*
*But murder changes everything*
*Murder makes us all*
*Suspects in the dark*

### **VERSE 2 - DEEPER TRUTHS (More intense, overlapping faster)**

**RUBY** (Building intensity):
*She said my mother was coming back*
*Said she had news, had hope*
*But then she laughed*
*Said some mothers*
*Don't deserve forgiveness*
*What did she know?*
*What was she hiding?*

**TOMMY** (Panic setting in):
*The pills she gave me*
*Weren't for my sister*
*They were for him*
*For the man I love*
*The man who's dying*
*While I dance and smile*
*And pretend I'm normal*

**HELENA** (Breaking down):
*She had photographs*
*Of what I did*
*Of who I betrayed*
*Said she'd keep them safe*
*As long as I stayed useful*
*As long as I obeyed*

**JONATHAN** (Desperation):
*The gambling debts*
*Weren't gambling*
*They were payments*
*To bring my cousin home*
*From the camps that still exist*
*In countries we don't name*

**MAGGIE** (Fierce protection):
*I sold her information*
*About the other families*
*About who was hiding*
*Who was lying*
*Who was next*
*To save my own*

**EDDIE** (Complete breakdown):
*My daughter doesn't know*
*Her college fund is gone*
*Spent on protection*
*Spent on silence*
*Spent on staying alive*
*One more day*

### **BRIDGE - FRANK'S REALIZATION**

**FRANK** (Irish folk melody, but modern and harsh):
*Jesus Christ, what have I found?*
*Not a simple murder case*
*But a web of desperation*
*A network of the lost*
*Each one protecting*
*What they can't afford to lose*
*Each one hiding*
*What they can't afford to tell*

*But one of you*
*Crossed the line*
*One of you*
*Chose murder over truth*
*And I'll find you*
*Even if it destroys*
*Everything you've built*

### **CHORUS 2 - EXPLOSIVE CLIMAX**

**ALL** (Full voice, desperate, each in their native language simultaneously):

**RUBY** (Polish): *Nie mogę już kłamać!* (I can't lie anymore!)
**TOMMY** (Italian): *Non posso più nascondermi!* (I can't hide anymore!)
**HELENA** (German): *Ich kann nicht mehr schweigen!* (I can't stay silent anymore!)
**JONATHAN** (Hebrew): *Ani lo yachol od!* (I can't anymore!)
**MAGGIE** (Taishanese): *Ngo m-ho joi bei-mat!* (I can't keep secrets!)
**EDDIE** (Italian): *Basta! Basta!* (Enough! Enough!)

**ALL** (English, building to scream):
*We all have secrets!*
*We all have lies!*
*We all have blood*
*On our hands tonight!*
*But only one of us*
*Is a killer!*
*Only one of us*
*Crossed that line!*

*WHO?*
*WHO?*
*WHO KILLED VIVIAN STERLING?*

### **OUTRO - WHISPERED CONFESSIONS**

**ALL** (Separately, overlapping, barely audible):
*It could have been me...*
*It should have been me...*
*It might have been me...*
*But it wasn't me...*
*Was it?*

*Was it?*

**FRANK** (Final line, spoken over fading music):
That's what we're going to find out.
