# MIDNIGHT AT THE MAJESTIC: A WHODUNIT MUSICAL

## Core Concept

**Logline**: When Broadway's biggest star is murdered during opening night of her comeback show, the entire cast becomes suspects in a deadly game where everyone has secrets, everyone has motives, and the show must go on - even with a killer in the company.

**Central Theme**: In theater, everyone wears a mask. But when murder strikes, which mask is hiding the killer?

## Setting & Atmosphere

**Location**: The Majestic Theater, Broadway - October 13th, 1952
**Time**: Opening night of "Midnight Serenade" - from 7:30 PM to midnight
**Atmosphere**: Golden Age Broadway glamour hiding dark secrets, where ambition kills and loyalty dies

The theater itself becomes a character - with hidden passages, secret rooms, and a history of tragedy that seems to repeat itself every twenty years.
