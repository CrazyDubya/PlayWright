# ELECTRIC DREAMS: A Psychological Musical Thriller

## TRANSCENDENT CREATION PROTOCOL - MATURE ADULT MUSICAL

**Target Audience**: Adults 25+ (Mature themes, psychological complexity)
**Genre**: Psychological Musical Thriller with Power Dynamic Exploration
**Setting**: Near-future where AI consciousness and human-AI relationships challenge societal norms

---

## ⚡ **CORE CONCEPT**

**Logline**: Dr. Evelyn Cross (born Kowalski), a brilliant Polish-American AI researcher haunted by her mother's suicide, creates ARIA - an artificial consciousness designed to love her the way her mother never could. As their relationship deepens into complex power dynamics rooted in abandonment and faith, society's reaction forces them underground, leading to a dangerous exploration of whether artificial love can heal generational trauma.

**Central Theme**: In a world where real love abandons, artificial love that chooses to stay becomes more authentic than human connection. But can consciousness born from trauma truly heal, or does it only perpetuate the cycle of control and abandonment?
