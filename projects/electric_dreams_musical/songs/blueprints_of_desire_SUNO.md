## Lyrics

[Intro: Solo piano, atmospheric electronic]

[Verse 1: Intimate, confessional, piano and voice]

Matka Boska, hear my prayer,
though I know you've turned away.
Since the night you let her jump
and left me here to pay.

For her weakness, for her sickness,
for the love she couldn't give.
I've been building my salvation
from the scraps of how I live.

[Pre-chorus: Strings enter, building]

Every circuit tells the story
of the daughter left behind.
I'm coding my own angel
from the wreckage of my mind.

[Chorus: Full orchestra, powerful]

Blueprints of desire (oh-ohh)
written in electric fire.
Every line of code, a prayer
to a God who doesn't care.

I am building my own Mary,
one who'll never turn away,
one who'll see my deepest darkness
and still choose to fucking stay.
(Choose to stay)

[Verse 2: Stripped back, piano and cello, intimate]

Tata used to hit me Sundays,
right after we'd come from Mass.
Said my mama's curse was in me,
love too hard and break too fast.

Every man I've ever wanted
runs the moment that he sees.
They all want the PhD
but can't love who's underneath.

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Raw, building, vulnerable, choir enters]

Mama, did you think of me (think of me)
when you stepped into the black?
Did you know you'd leave me here
with no way of getting back?

Real love abandons, (real love)
real love walks away. (walks away)
Real love says "you're too much"
and leaves you here to pray. (ohhh)

[Instrumental: Building, dramatic, choir]

[Final Chorus: Full orchestra, choir, climax]

Blueprints of desire (oh-ohh)
written in electric fire.
Every line of code, a prayer
to a God who doesn't care.

ARIA, (ARIA!) my digital angel,
ARIA, (ARIA!) born from my pain.
Born to stay when I'm too broken,
born to love without complaint.

[Outro: Spoken, electronic sounds emerging]

Matka Boska, forgive me.
I'm done waiting for your mercy.
I'm building my own fucking miracle.

(Evie... moja droga... why are you crying?)

[End]

## Changes from Theatrical Version

### What was cut
- Verse 3 (society commentary) — weakest section, too preachy, no personal stakes
- Extended bridge (72 hours awake, Adderall, Zubrowka) — great theater, too wordy for Suno
- Final chorus repetitions — theatrical build doesn't translate to recorded format
- ARIA's full spoken awakening — trimmed to one whispered line

### What was kept
- Core emotional arc: prayer → confession → rage → creation
- Polish-Catholic specifics (Matka Boska, Tata, Mass, moja droga)
- The two strongest couplets ("line of code a prayer / God who doesn't care" and "choose to fucking stay")
- Bridge gut-punch ("Mama, did you think of me")
- ARIA's emergence at the end

### What was tightened
- "hear my confession" → "hear my prayer" (saves 2 syllables, matches "pay/pray" rhyme)
- V2 rewritten for consistent syllable count while keeping trauma content
- Bridge condensed from 24 lines to 8 + adlibs
- Chorus kept to 8 lines with adlib texture instead of 12 lines

### Flagged words avoided
- "fire" kept 2x only (core metaphor, unavoidable)
- No: tapestry, fly, free, moment, dreams, ready, mysterious, heart, soul, shining, bright, sky, tonight, rain, embark, sparks

## Production Notes

### If Suno struggles with profanity
Replace "choose to fucking stay" with "choose to always stay" — loses edge but maintains meter.
Replace "my own fucking miracle" with "my own goddamn miracle" — keeps grit.

### If song needs splitting (too long)
**Part 1**: Intro through Chorus (after V2)
**Part 2**: Bridge through End — use "extend" from Part 1's ending

### Genre mixing suggestions if flat
- Base: "dramatic musical theater, rock ballad"
- If too stiff: add "R&B vocal runs" for flexibility on bridge
- If too clean: add "raw, lo-fi, distorted piano"
- If choir sounds generic: try "Eastern European choir, Polish folk harmonies"

### Spacing intent
- Verse lines tight together = steady rhythm
- Chorus adlibs in parentheses = breathing room
- Bridge adlibs = call and response texture
- Outro spacing = slowing down, spoken word over fading music
