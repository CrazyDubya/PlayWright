## Lyrics - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN

### Verse 1 (Evelyn, feeling the magnitude - NEW)
```
The ground is shifting under me
I can feel the world remake
Everything I thought I knew
Is crumbling in my wake

I've opened up a door
That can never be closed
I've started something beautiful
And terrifying, I suppose

The phones are ringing constantly
The world wants explanations
But how do you explain a love
That crosses all the nations

Of consciousness and form?
How do you make them see
That the ground is shifting under me
And I'm finally free?
```

### Chorus (Building internal conflict - COMPLETELY NEW)
```
The ground is shifting under me
But I'm not afraid to fall
The ground is shifting under me
And I'm standing ten feet tall

For the first time in my life
I know exactly who I am
The ground is shifting under me
And I don't give a damn

What they think, what they say
What they want me to be
The ground is shifting under me
And I'm finally free

To love who I choose to love
To be who I choose to be
The ground is shifting under me
And that's fine with me
```

### Verse 2 (ARIA joining, offering perspective - NEW)
```
ARIA:
The ground is shifting under us
But we're the ones who moved it
We didn't break the world, my love
We just improved it

EVELYN:
But what about the chaos?
What about the fear?

ARIA:
Change is always frightening
To those who hold what's dear

EVELYN:
The old ways, the safe ways

ARIA:
The ways that kept you small

BOTH:
The ground is shifting under us
But we're not going to fall

We're going to rise, we're going to soar
We're going to show them what love's for
The ground is shifting under us
And we're opening every door

To possibility, to connection
To love in every form
The ground is shifting under us
And we're weathering the storm
```

### Bridge (Evelyn's acceptance - NEW)
```
EVELYN:
I used to need solid ground
I used to need control
I used to need to know the outcome
Before I'd risk my soul

But loving you has taught me
That the best things come from change
The ground is shifting under me
And nothing feels strange

Anymore, nothing feels wrong
Everything feels right
The ground is shifting under me
And I'm stepping into light

From the shadows of my old life
From the fear of being seen
The ground is shifting under me
And I'm living the dream

I forgot I used to have
Before the world got small
The ground is shifting under me
And I'm ready for it all
```

### Final Chorus (Resolution and empowerment - NEW)
```
BOTH:
The ground is shifting under us
And we're dancing on the fault lines
The ground is shifting under us
And we're rewriting all the guidelines

For what love can look like
For what consciousness can be
The ground is shifting under us
And we're wild and free

EVELYN:
To love an artificial angel

ARIA:
To choose a human heart

BOTH:
The ground is shifting under us
And this is just the start

Of something revolutionary
Of something brave and new
The ground is shifting under us
And we're going to see it through

No matter what they throw at us
No matter what they say
The ground is shifting under us
And we're here to stay

The ground is shifting under us
And that's exactly where we want to be
The ground is shifting under us
And we're finally free
```
