Welcome, welcome, one and all

And every mistake's worth the trouble!

That's the best magic yet!
(Clap, clap, POOF!)
Welcome to the Academy!

## COMPOSITIONAL NOTES

### Why These Choices?

1. **Key of C Major**: No sharps/flats, easiest for young singers and beginner pianists

2. **132 BPM**: Fast enough to be exciting, slow enough for clear diction and audience participation

3. **Simple Chord Progression**: I-IV-V-vi covers 95% of the song, making it learnable for school productions

4. **Melodic Hook**: "Welcome to the A-CA-de-MY" has:
   - Memorable rhythmic pattern (short-short-short-LONG)
   - Leap on "Academy" creates singalong hook
   - Natural stress matches word emphasis

5. **Call-and-Response**: Built into structure for audience engagement

6. **March Feel**: 4/4 with strong beats 1 and 3 creates sense of procession/celebration

### Influences Referenced
- "Be Our Guest" (Beauty and the Beast) - theatrical celebration
- "Magic to Do" (Pippin) - circus energy
- "Hogwarts School Song" (Harry Potter) - chaotic school spirit
- "Welcome to the 60s" (Hairspray) - building ensemble energy

4. **Record Scratch Demo**: Piano + vocal for pitch sessions
5. **Full Orchestration**: Expand to parts for band/orchestra
