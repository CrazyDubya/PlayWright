## LYRICS

### Verse 1 (Pip, tentative and nervous)
🎵 *I'm standing at the doorway*
*Of a place I've never been*
*Everyone seems so confident*
*I don't know where to begin*

*They all have special magic*
*That sparkles, pops, and glows*
*But what if mine is different?*
*What if nothing shows?*

### Chorus (Building hope)
🎵 *I want to belong here*
*I want to find my place*
*I want to make some magic*
*And see a friendly face*

*I want to belong here*
*Not stand here all alone*
*I want this academy*
*To feel just like home*

### Verse 2 (Pip, observing others)
🎵 *Look at Perfecta's perfect spells*
*They shimmer gold and bright*
*And Giggles makes everyone laugh*
*With magic that's just right*

*Even Whisper's quiet magic*
*Has a gentle, peaceful glow*
*But when I try to cast a spell*
*Nothing seems to show*

### Chorus (More yearning)
🎵 *I want to belong here*
*I want to find my place*
*I want to make some magic*
*And see a friendly face*

*I want to belong here*
*Not stand here all alone*
*I want this academy*
*To feel just like home*

### Bridge (Vulnerable, almost spoken)
🎵 *Maybe I'm not magical*
*Maybe I don't fit*
*Maybe I should turn around*
*And just... forget about it*

*(Pause, then with growing determination)*

*But something deep inside me says*
*"Don't give up just yet"*
*Maybe my magic's different*
*Maybe... I just haven't found it yet*

### Final Chorus (With hope and determination)
🎵 *I want to belong here* *(Ensemble softly: "You belong")*
*I want to find my place* *(Ensemble: "You'll find it")*
*I want to make some magic* *(Ensemble: "You will")*
*And see a friendly face* *(Ensemble: "We're here")*

*I want to belong here* *(Ensemble: "You belong here")*
*Not stand here all alone* *(Ensemble: "You're not alone")*
*I want this academy* *(Ensemble: "This academy")*
*To feel just like home* *(All: "Will be your home")*

### Outro (Pip, with new resolve)
🎵 *So I'll take a deep breath*
*And I'll walk through that door*
*'Cause maybe belonging*
*Is what magic is for*

*(Soft magical chime as Pip steps forward)*
