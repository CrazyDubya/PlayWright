## LYRICS

### Verse 1 (Professor, gentle and wise)
🎵 *Come sit beside me, little one*
*I see the sadness in your eyes*
*You think your magic isn't working*
*But let me share what I've realized*

*Long ago, I was just like you*
*My spells never worked quite right*
*I tried so hard to be perfect*
*I nearly gave up the fight*

### Chorus (Professor, building warmth)
🎵 *But the most beautiful magic*
*Isn't always what you see*
*Sometimes it's quiet, sometimes it's hidden*
*Sometimes it's just being free*

*The most beautiful magic*
*Comes from deep inside your heart*
*It's not about the perfect spell*
*It's about the perfect start*

### Verse 2 (Professor, sharing his story)
🎵 *One day I tried to grow a flower*
*But instead I grew a tree*
*That tree became a home for birds*
*Who sang in harmony*

*I thought I'd made a big mistake*
*But the birds sang out so clear*
*"Your magic gave us what we needed*
*A place to call home here"*

### Chorus (Repeat, with growing understanding)
🎵 *'Cause the most beautiful magic*
*Isn't always what you see*
*Sometimes it's quiet, sometimes it's hidden*
*Sometimes it's just being free*

*The most beautiful magic*
*Comes from deep inside your heart*
*It's not about the perfect spell*
*It's about the perfect start*

### Bridge (Professor, revealing Pip's gift)
🎵 *Now Pip, your magic is special*
*It's called "Possibility Magic"*
*You don't just change what already is*
*You create something fantastic*

*When you turned Sparkles to a disco ball*
*You didn't make a mistake*
*You gave our friend a chance to shine*
*And joy for all to take*

### Verse 3 (Pip, beginning to understand)
🎵 *PIP: "You mean... I didn't break the spell?"*
*PROFESSOR: "You made something entirely new"*
*PIP: "I thought I was doing everything wrong"*
*PROFESSOR: "You were being perfectly you"*

### Magical Objects Chorus (Enchanted items joining in)
🎵 *BROKEN CLOCK: "He fixed my tick with a tock-tick beat!"*
*UPSIDE-DOWN BOOK: "He helped me read from bottom to top!"*
*BACKWARDS BROOM: "He taught me sweeping can be neat!"*
*CONFUSED CAULDRON: "He made my bubbling never stop!"*

### Final Chorus (All, with full realization)
🎵 *Yes, the most beautiful magic* *(Pip: "Beautiful magic")*
*Isn't always what you see* *(Objects: "What you see")*
*Sometimes it's quiet, sometimes it's hidden* *(Professor: "Hidden deep")*
*Sometimes it's just being free* *(All: "Being free")*

*The most beautiful magic* *(Pip: "My magic")*
*Comes from deep inside your heart* *(Professor: "Your heart")*
*It's not about the perfect spell* *(Objects: "Perfect spell")*
*It's about the perfect start* *(All: "Perfect start")*

### Outro (Pip, with new confidence)
🎵 *PIP: "So when I make things different..."*
*PROFESSOR: "You're making them just right"*
*PIP: "And when I try to help my friends..."*
*PROFESSOR: "You fill their world with light"*

*ALL: "The most beautiful magic*
*Is the magic that you are*
*Not perfect, but perfectly you*
*Our bright and shining star"*

*(Gentle magical chime as understanding dawns)*
