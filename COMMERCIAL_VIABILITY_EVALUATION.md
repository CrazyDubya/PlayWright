**Key Conditions:**
1. Complete legal foundation (licensing, trademarks) - MUST HAVE
2. Finish 2-3 flagship musicals - CREDIBILITY
3. Build web MVP - MARKET ACCESS
4. Achieve 50+ beta users with positive feedback - VALIDATION
5. Secure 2+ educational pilot partnerships - REVENUE PROOF

**Expected Returns:**
- **Conservative:** 3-5x in 5 years (bootstrap scenario)
- **Moderate:** 10-20x in 5-7 years (successful SaaS exit)
- **Optimistic:** 50-100x in 7-10 years (category leader, strategic acquisition)

**Exit Strategies:**
1. **Strategic acquisition** by Final Draft, Adobe, or entertainment company (most likely, 5-7 years)
2. **Independent SaaS** business with dividend distribution (lifestyle business option)
3. **Merger** with complementary creative AI tool (consolidation play)
4. **IPO** if achieve category dominance (low probability, 10+ years)

### The Opportunity

PlayWright sits at the intersection of three powerful trends:
1. **AI-assisted creativity** (fastest-growing software category)
2. **Cultural authenticity** (social imperative in entertainment)
3. **Democratized content creation** (creator economy boom)

With strategic development, this could become the **"Final Draft for the AI era"** - the industry-standard tool for musical theater creation.

**The question is not whether this can work, but whether there's the will and resources to execute the vision.**
