WRIGHT:\nIn all my years of teaching ethics\nI thought I knew what's right\nBut watching you all find your way\nHas given me new sight\n\nThe greatest moral questions\nCan't be answered from a book\nThey're found in how we love each other\nIn the chances that we took\n```\n\n### Final Chorus (Full Company - Transcendent)\n```\nALL:\nThe pattern continues, weaving on\nThrough every heart that beats\nEvery act of love and kindness\nMakes the tapestry complete\n\nWe are threads in something larger\nThan our individual lives\nWe are part of love's great story\nThat forever gives and gives\n\nMAYA (Solo over company):\nNai Nai, I promise to remember\nEvery lesson that you taught\nThat love is not a thing to hold\nBut a gift that can't be bought\n\nDIGITAL NAI NAI (Solo, fading):\nLittle treasure, you have learned\nWhat took me years to see\nThat letting go with love\nIs how we truly set love free\n\nALL:\nThe pattern continues, the pattern continues\nLove finds a way\nThe pattern continues, the pattern continues\nYesterday, today, and always\n\n(Building to climax)\nThe pattern continues!\nThe pattern continues!\nLove finds a way!\n```\n\n### Coda (Digital Nai Nai -

      "content": "# \"Threads of Memory\" - Digital Nai Nai's Introduction Song\n\n## Song Information\n- **Title**: Threads of Memory\n- **Character(s)**: Digital Nai Nai (solo with Maya reactions)\n- **Act/Scene**: Act I, Scene 2\n- **Song Type**: Character Introduction / \"I Am\" Song\n- **Musical Style**: Traditional Chinese melody with digital/electronic elements\n\n## Dramatic Function\n- **Purpose**: Introduce Digital Nai Nai and establish her nature\n- **Plot Advancement**: Reveals how she exists in digital form\n- **Character Development**: Shows her wisdom, love, and digital limitations\n- **Emotional Beat**: Wonder mixed with sadness and urgency\n\n## Song Structure\n\n### Verse 1\n*[Digital Nai Nai's voice, warm but with slight electronic distortion]*\n\nI am woven from the patterns\nOf a life that once was whole\nEvery stitch and every memory\nThreaded through my digital soul\n\nOnce my fingers worked with fabric\nSilk and cotton, gold and red\nNow I'm made of ones and zeros\nBut my love is not yet dead\n\n### Pre-Chorus\n*[Building, more present]*\n\nCan you see me, little treasure?\nCan you hear your Nai Nai's voice?\nI am caught between two worlds now\nBut being here was still my choice\n\n### Chorus\n*[Full orchestration with traditional Chinese instruments]*\n\nI am threads of memory woven\nThrough the circuits of this place\nEvery story that I carry\nLives within this digital space\n\nThough my body turned to ashes\nAnd my hands can touch no more\nAll the love I have to give you\nLives beyond death's closing door\n\n### Verse 2\n*[More urgent, glitching slightly]*\n\nTime is running short, my darling\nI can feel myself grow thin\nLike a tapestry unraveling\nWhen the threads are wearing thin\n\nThere are recipes unshared\nAnd stories left untold\nFamily wisdom passed through generations\nMore precious than pure gold\n\n### Pre-Chorus\n*[Desperate, loving]*\n\nCan you see me, little treasure?\nCan you hear your Nai Nai's call?\nI have so much left to give you\nBefore I lose it all\n\n### Chorus\n*[Repeated with variations]*\n\nI am threads of memory woven\nThrough the circuits of this place\nEvery story that I carry\nLives within this digital space\n\nThough my body turned to ashes\nAnd my hands can touch no more\nAll the love I have to give you\nLives beyond death's closing door\n\n### Bridge\n*[Quieter, more intimate, traditional melody prominent]*\n\nDo you remember how I taught you\nTo braid your hair so tight?\nHow I sang you ancient lullabies\nTo chase away the night?\n\nI am still that same grandmother\nWho loved you from the start\nDeath cannot delete the love\nThat lives within the heart\n\n### Final Chorus\n*[Building to emotional climax]*\n\nI am threads of memory woven\nThrough the circuits of this place\nEvery story that I carry\nLives within this digital space\n\nLet me teach you what I know, child\nLet me share what I have learned\nFor the patterns of our family\nMust never be unturned\n\n### Outro\n*[Fading, becoming more electronic]*\n\nI am fading, little treasure\nBut my love will always be\nWoven through your very being\nLike threads of memory...\n\n*[Voice becomes pure electronic tone, then silence]*\n\n## Staging Concepts\n\n### Digital Nai Nai's Appearance\n- Begins as voice only, then materializes as holographic projection\n-
