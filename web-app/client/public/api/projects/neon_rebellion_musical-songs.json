throw away\nEverything I've built, everything I've tried\n\nI have a future, I have a plan\nI have a life that makes sense\nWhy would I risk it all for this\nFor your dangerous pretense?\n\nSafe is smart, safe is sane\nSafe means I won't lose everything\nSorry, but I can't afford\nTo gamble on what rebellion brings\n```\n\n### Verse 2 (Riot, challenging her worldview)\n```\nRIOT:\nYou call it safety, I call it prison\nYou call it smart, I call it fear\nYou're asking me to understand\nWhy you'd choose chains when freedom's here\n\nYou have a future that's not your own\nYou have a plan that's not your choice\nYou have a life that's killing your soul\nWhile silencing your voice\n\nSorry, but safe is just another word\nFor giving up before you start\nSafe is what they want you to choose\nWhen you're afraid to follow your heart\n```\n\n### Chorus 1 (Both, arguing their positions)\n```\nZARA:\nSafe or sorry, that's the choice\nSafe or sorry, I know which one's wise\n\nRIOT:\nSafe or sorry, that's the choice\nSafe or sorry, but safe is just disguise\n\nZARA:\nFor cowardice and foolish dreams\n\nRIOT:\nFor living life the way it seems\n\nBOTH:\nYou're supposed to live\nBut what if there's more to give?\n\nZARA:\nI'd rather be safe than sorry\n\nRIOT:\nI'd rather be sorry than safe\n```\n\n### Bridge (Zara, revealing her deeper fears)\n```\nZARA:\nYou don't understand what I could lose\nMy father's love, my family's pride\nMy future, my security\nEverything I am inside\n\nWhat if I try and I fail?\nWhat if I'm not who you think?\nWhat if I jump and there's nothing there\nAnd I fall into the drink?\n\nI've worked so hard to be perfect\nI've sacrificed so much to succeed\nHow can you ask me to throw it away\nFor something I might not even need?\n```\n\n### Bridge (Riot, revealing his understanding)\n```\nRIOT:\nI understand more than you know\nI had everything you think you want\nA perfect life, a perfect future\nA perfect family to flaunt\n\nBut perfect is just another cage\nWith golden bars and silver locks\nAnd when you're dying inside that cage\nThe beauty of it mocks\n\nEverything you could have been\nEverything you'll never be\nIf you choose safety over truth\nYou'll never be free\n```\n\n### Final Chorus (Both, with growing intensity)\n```\nZARA:\nSafe or sorry, I choose safe\nEven if it means I'll never know\n\nRIOT:\nSafe or sorry, I choose sorry\nEven if it means I'll have to go\n\nZARA:\nThrough life wondering what if\n\nRIOT:\nThrough life knowing what is\n\nBOTH:\nReal and true and worth the risk\nWorth the pain, worth the fight\n\nZARA:\nBut I can't see beyond the fear\n\nRIOT:\nBut I can't live without the light\n\nZARA:\nI'd rather be safe than sorry\n\nRIOT:\nI'd rather be sorry than safe\n\nBOTH:\nAnd maybe that's the difference\nBetween a life that's real\nAnd a life that's just... safe\n```\n\n### Outro (Unresolved, both questioning)\n```\nZARA:\n(Quietly, to herself)\nBut what if safe isn't really safe at all?\n\nRIOT:\n(Quietly, to himself)\nAnd what if sorry is too high a price to pay?\n\nBOTH:\n(Looking at each other)\nSafe or sorry...\nSafe or sorry...\nWhich way leads to who I'm meant to be?\n```\n\n## Staging Notes\n\n### Physical Movement\n- **Opening**: Zara and Riot on opposite sides of stage, representing their positions\n- **Verse
