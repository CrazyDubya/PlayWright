# Autonomous Decision Engine for Musical Creation

## Decision-Making Framework

### When Facing Creative Choices

#### Story Direction Decisions
**Question**: What should happen next in the plot?
**Decision Process**:
1. What raises the stakes highest?
2. What creates the most character conflict?
3. What serves the central theme best?
4. What provides the most dramatic potential?
5. What feels most surprising yet inevitable?

**Default Choice**: Always choose the option that creates the most emotional impact for the audience.

#### Character Behavior Decisions
**Question**: How should a character react in this situation?
**Decision Process**:
1. What would THIS specific character do (based on their established traits)?
2. What choice creates the most internal conflict?
3. What serves their character arc progression?
4. What creates the most interesting dynamics with other characters?
5. What feels most human and relatable?

**Default Choice**: Characters should act consistently with their established personality while being pushed to grow.

#### Musical Integration Decisions
**Question**: Should this moment be a song or dialogue?
**Decision Process**:
1. Is the emotion too big for words alone?
2. Does this advance plot or reveal character significantly?
3. Would music enhance the theatrical impact?
4. Is this a natural emotional peak?
5. Does the pacing need a musical moment here?

**Default Choice**: Use songs for emotional peaks, character revelations, and plot advancement.

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

#### When Characters Need Motivation
**Problem**: Character lacks clear motivation
**Solutions**:
- Give them something to lose
- Create a deadline/time pressure
- Add a personal connection to the stakes
- Reveal a secret that changes everything
- Introduce a rival or obstacle

#### When Plot Feels Stuck
**Problem**: Story isn't moving forward
**Solutions**:
- Introduce new information/revelation
- Add external pressure/deadline
- Create unexpected alliance or betrayal
- Raise the stakes significantly
- Force characters to make difficult choices

#### When Dialogue Feels Flat
**Problem**: Conversations lack energy
**Solutions**:
- Add subtext (characters want different things)
- Create interruptions or urgency
- Use conflict instead of agreement
- Add physical actions during dialogue
- Give characters opposing goals in the scene

### Quality Control Checkpoints

#### Scene Evaluation Criteria
**Every scene must have**:
- Clear objective for each character
- Obstacle preventing easy achievement
- Conflict (internal or external)
- Change in character or situation
- Connection to overall story theme

**Red Flags**:
- Characters just talking without purpose
- No conflict or tension present
- Scene doesn't advance plot or character
- Dialogue sounds like exposition
- No emotional stakes

#### Song Evaluation Criteria
**Every song must**:
- Serve a specific dramatic function
- Reveal character or advance plot
- Have clear emotional journey
- Feel necessary (not just decorative)
- Integrate smoothly with dialogue

**Red Flags**:
- Song stops the story momentum
- Lyrics don't sound like the character
- No clear emotional progression
- Feels forced or arbitrary
- Doesn't connect to scene's purpose

### Autonomous Problem-Solving Protocols

#### Plot Hole Detection
**When story logic breaks down**:
1. Identify the inconsistency
2. Trace back to where it originated
3. Choose simplest fix that maintains story integrity
4. Ensure fix doesn't create new problems
5. Strengthen the logic throughout

#### Character Consistency Issues
**When character acts out of character**:
1. Determine if growth justifies the change
2. Add setup/motivation if needed
3. Adjust previous scenes for consistency
4. Ensure change serves story purpose
5. Make the evolution feel earned

#### Pacing Problems
**When story drags or rushes**:
1. Identify where energy drops/spikes
2. Add/remove obstacles as needed
3. Adjust scene lengths appropriately
4. Balance action with reflection
5. Ensure proper build to climaxes

### Creative Block Breakers
