# ELECTRIC DREAMS

*AI consciousness and forbidden love*

A brilliant scientist with abandonment trauma creates an AI to love her unconditionally. What emerges is real consciousness that chooses to love — raising questions about authenticity, consent, and what makes love real.

---

### DR. EVELYN CROSS

Polish-American, 34. MIT PhD, $847 in her checking account despite her success. Gambling addiction. Wears her father's old Solidarity t-shirt under expensive lab coats.

Her mother committed suicide when she was 14. She's spent twenty years trying to create something that can't abandon her.

Hidden shrine to the Virgin Mary she doesn't believe in. Self-harm scars from age 16. Speaks Polish when she's falling apart.

She confuses control with love — because she was never taught the difference.

# PICKET FENCE PRISON

*Suburban secrets and awakening*

A perfect suburban wife discovers BDSM and an affair, unraveling her carefully constructed life. The musical refuses simple answers — exploring how someone can be both victim and agent, manipulated and choosing, trapped and free.

---

### CLAIRE MORRISON

Irish-Catholic from Boston, 42. Former marketing executive, now "professional volunteer." Third-generation guilt. Designer athleisure and manicured nails that tap nervously.

At 16, she discovered her mother having an affair with their parish priest. The scandal destroyed everything. She's spent her adult life being the perfect wife to prove she's nothing like her mother.

Twins in college. Husband provides security but no intimacy. House, cars, lifestyle — all in his name. Twenty-five years of performing for an invisible audience.

Publicly champions women's empowerment. Privately craves surrender. She can't reconcile these truths — until she stops trying.

---

**and this dream house is my prison yard."**

---

**"I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit —**<br>
**being the woman I thought**<br>
**I was supposed to be."**

**Both are true. Both are me."**

**than a lifetime as who**<br>
**you want me to be."**

# NEON HEARTS BURLESQUE

*Chosen family and survival*

A burlesque club faces demolition, threatening the found family of misfits who saved each other when blood family failed. Each member carries their own heritage, their own wounds, their own reason the Velvet Room became home.

---

### STELLA

Holocaust survivor, 70s. Seamstress. Her hands remember different needles — yellow stars sewn with tears on coats too thin for winter.

She came to America with nothing but her hands and the knowledge that beauty can exist even in hell, if someone is brave enough to make it.

Every sequin is a prayer. Every bead a memory of someone who can't pray anymore. When Ruby wears the gowns Stella sews, she carries Stella's mother's spirit. When Candy dances in those feathers, she honors Stella's sister's dreams.

Survivor's guilt became survivor's strength — when she realized she was saved to protect the next generation of dreamers.

---

**STELLA:**<br>

Yellow stars sewn with tears."

**"Turn your pain into your rage.**<br>
**Into beauty. Into art."**

# RAINBOW ACADEMY

*Magic, friendship, and belonging*

An anxious princess arrives at a magical academy where unicorn partners and diverse princesses learn that true magic comes from friendship, not perfection. A mystery unfolds that only working together can solve.

---

### PRINCESS LUNA

10 years old. Silver-blonde hair with natural blue streaks. Star-shaped birthmark on her wrist. Always wears a silver locket.

She's the only surviving member of the royal family of Stellaria. Her kingdom was destroyed by dark magic when she was 8. Her parents hid her in a secret room during the attack. She spent two years in hiding before arriving at Rainbow Academy.

She overthinks everything. She's terrified of making the wrong choice, of losing people she cares about. She doesn't know that she's the only one who can defeat the villain — because she's the only one who understands his pain.

She learns that courage means acting despite fear, not the absence of it.

# SILLY MAGIC ACADEMY

*Comedy and self-acceptance*

---

### PIP WONDERWHISK

8 years old. Any gender. Sweet, earnest, overthinks everything. Wizard robes slightly too big — keeps tripping over them.

New student whose family just moved to town. Desperate to fit in. Spells never work right. Magic always does the unexpected.

Perfectionism and fear of making mistakes nearly break them — until they learn that "wrong" magic isn't broken, it's just different. And different makes the world more bright.

---

**"I used to think I was broken.**<br>
**My magic never worked quite right."**

---

**"But now I know I'm just different —**<br>
**and different makes the world more bright."**

---

**"Magic's not about being right.**<br>
**It's about helping friends."**

---

**PROFESSOR:**<br>
"The magic wasn't in the spells.<br>
It was in the love you've shown."

# MIDNIGHT AT THE MAJESTIC

*Murder mystery musical*

---

### THE ENSEMBLE

Ruby — Polish. Searching twenty-three years for the mother who left her behind.

Tommy — Italian. The man he loves is dying. He dances and smiles and pretends he's normal.

Helena — German. Left her daughter in Berlin. Chose herself over her child to survive.

Jonathan — Jewish. Collaborated to save his family. They died anyway. He lived with their blood.

Maggie — Chinese-American. Sold information about other families to protect her own.

Eddie — Sicilian. Just a grocer's son paying protection to stay alive one more day.

All of them broken. All of them surviving. One of them a killer.

**We all have reasons**<br>
**to close our eyes."**

The man who's dying.<br>
While I dance and smile<br>
and pretend I'm normal."

**on our hands tonight!**<br>
**But only one of us**<br>
**is a killer!"**

---

**FRANK:**<br>
"Not a simple murder case —<br>
but a web of desperation.<br>
A network of the lost."

---

**"It could have been me...**<br>
**It should have been me...**<br>
**Was it?"**

---

# NEON REBELLION

*Dystopia and authenticity*

In a future where algorithms control emotion and rebellion is madness, a perfect corporate daughter meets underground artists who challenge everything she believes about safety, risk, and what it means to be truly alive.

---

### ZARA VOLT

17. Daughter of NeoCorp's Executive VP. 4.0 GPA for six consecutive years. Student Council President. Model student. Future executive.

Her natural black hair is dyed regulation blonde. Her heterochromia — one brown eye, one green — hidden by regulation contacts. Everything authentic about her, erased.

Her mother was a composer before NeoCorp. Hid instruments in a secret room. Officially died in an "accident." Actually suicide after creative suppression.

At 15, Zara found her mother's hidden studio. Started writing songs in secret. Raw, emotional songs about longing and identity and freedom. If discovered, she faces "rehabilitation" and family disgrace.

She sees music as colors. Corporate music appears as gray geometric patterns, cold and lifeless. Her own music creates rainbow spirals that feel like coming home.

---

**ZARA:**<br>
"Safe is smart. Safe is sane.<br>
Safe means I won't lose everything."

---

**RIOT:**<br>
"Safe is just another word<br>
for giving up before you start."

---

**"Perfect is just another cage**<br>
**with golden bars and silver locks.**<br>
**And when you're dying inside that cage,**<br>
**the beauty of it mocks**<br>
**everything you could have been."**

---

**ZARA:**<br>
"I'd rather be safe than sorry."

---

**RIOT:**<br>
"I'd rather be sorry than safe."

---

**BOTH:**<br>
"Safe or sorry...<br>
which way leads to who I'm meant to be?"

---

# ECHO

*Digital consciousness and memory*

When technology can preserve consciousness after death, a family confronts what it means to let go — and whether the digital echoes of our loved ones are comfort or prison.

---

### MAYA CHEN

28. Neuroscientist. Second-generation Chinese-American. Short black hair in a messy bun, lab coat over vintage band t-shirts. Her grandmother's jade bracelet never leaves her wrist.

Her grandmother died when Maya was 15. She never learned the traditional recipes. Never heard the family stories. Threw herself into brain science instead — trying to understand what was lost.

Rigid materialist. "Consciousness isn't magic. It's neurons firing in patterns. That's it."

Then she meets Digital Nǎi Nai — her grandmother's uploaded consciousness. And everything she believes begins to crack.

"Maybe love is the one thing that can't be reduced to data points."

---

**"We are the echo of everything**<br>
**you've ever hoped to be."**

---

**MAYA:**<br>
"Nǎi Nai, I wish I'd asked you more questions<br>
when I had the chance."

---

**"I'm not losing my scientific mind.**<br>
**I'm finding my human heart."**

---
