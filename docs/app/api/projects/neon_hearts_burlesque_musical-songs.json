Costumes hanging like ghosts, makeup scattered across a cracked mirror. She's practicing her routine, but her mind is on the Flamingo audition. This is her \"I Want\" song - raw ambition mixed with guilt.\n\n**FUNCTION:** Establish Candy's hunger for stardom and the moral compromises she's willing to make.\n\n**STYLE:** Contemporary musical theater with Polish folk undertones. Builds from vulnerable confession to explosive declaration of ambition.\n\n---\n\n## SONG STRUCTURE\n\n### **VERSE 1 - THE HUNGER**\n\n**CANDY** (Looking at herself in the cracked mirror):\n*In this cracked and broken mirror*\n*I see someone else's face*\n*Not the factory worker's daughter*\n*From that cold Detroit place*\n*I see sequins, I see spotlights*\n*I see my name up in lights*\n*I see everything I've dreamed of*\n*Just beyond these sleepless nights*\n\n*Mama works three jobs to feed us*\n*Papa's gone, ain't coming back*\n*And I'm dancing in my underwear*\n*For tips and a snack*\n*But I got something they don't see*\n*I got fire in my soul*\n*And I'll do whatever it takes*\n*To reach my goal*\n\n### **CHORUS 1 - THE DECLARATION**\n\n**CANDY** (Building intensity):\n*I want more than this*\n*More than tips in a jar*\n*I want my name in neon*\n*I want to be a star*\n*I want the world to know*\n*That Candy Cane can shine*\n*I want it all*\n*And I want it to be mine*\n\n*Dreams don't wait*\n*For the loyal or the kind*\n*Dreams are for the hungry*\n*Dreams are for the blind*\n*To everything but wanting*\n*Everything but need*\n*I'll plant my flag on stardom*\n*Whatever the deed*\n\n### **VERSE 2 - THE GUILT**\n\n**CANDY** (Softer, conflicted):\n*Ruby took me in when I was nothing*\n*Taught me how to move, how to be*\n*Stella made my costumes*\n*Max believed in me*\n*They're my family, they're my teachers*\n*They're the ones who made me whole*\n*But family don't pay the rent*\n*And love don't reach my goal*\n\n*I see the writing on the wall*\n*This place is going down*\n*And I can sink here with the ship*\n*Or swim to higher ground*\n*It ain't betrayal if it's survival*\n*It ain't wrong if it's smart*\n*Sometimes you got to break a few*\n*To mend your own heart*\n\n### **BRIDGE - THE JUSTIFICATION**\n\n**CANDY** (Rapid-fire, convincing herself):\n*The Flamingo's got real money*\n*Real stages, real crowds*\n*Not this faded velvet palace*\n*Where dreams die in the clouds*\n*Of cigarette smoke and whiskey*\n*And bills that never end*\n*I could send money to Mama*\n*I could finally transcend*\n\n*This neighborhood, this struggle*\n*This hand-to-mouth existence*\n*I could be somebody special*\n*With just a little distance*\n*From the guilt and the loyalty*\n*That's holding me down*\n*I could be the brightest star*\n*In this whole damn town*\n\n### **CHORUS 2 - THE ESCALATION**\n\n**CANDY** (Full voice, no holding back):\n*I want more than this*\n*More than Ruby's approval*\n*I want stages that matter*\n*I want my removal*\n*From this dying little world*\n*To something big and bright*\n*I want it all*\n*And I'll take it tonight*\n\n*Dreams don't wait*\n*For permission or blessing*\n*Dreams are for the ruthless*\n*Dreams are for the pressing*\n*Forward through the guilt*\n*Forward through the pain*\n*I'll be more than Candace Kowalski*\n*I'll be Candy Cane*\n\n### **FINAL VERSE - THE DECISION**\n\n**CANDY** (With terrible clarity):\n*So I'll go to that audition*\n*I'll smile and I'll perform*\n*I'll show them what I'm made of*\n*In my sexiest form*\n*And if they offer me the contract*\n*If they want to make me theirs*\n*I'll sign it without looking back*\n*Despite Ruby's tears*\n\n*'Cause in this world of neon hearts*\n*And broken dreams for sale*\n*The only way to make it*\n*Is to never let yourself fail*\n*And failure is staying loyal*\n*When loyalty means you're poor*\n*So I'm walking through that door*\n*To something so much more*\n\n### **OUTRO - THE TRANSFORMATION**\n\n**CANDY** (Speaking, then singing softly):\n*(Speaking to her reflection)*\n*Goodbye, Candace Kowalski*\n*Factory worker's daughter*\n*Goodbye, little girl*\n*Who believed in family*\n\n*(Singing)*\n*Hello, Candy Cane*\n*Hello, bright new star*\n*Hello, to the woman*\n*Who'll go far*\n*No matter what*\n*It costs*\n*No matter who*\n*Gets lost*\n*Along the way*\n\n*(Music fades as she applies lipstick like war paint)*\n\n---\n\n## MUSICAL ARRANGEMENTS\n\n### **INSTRUMENTATION:**\n- Piano (driving, ambitious rhythm)\n- Strings (Polish folk melodies for heritage moments)\n- Brass (building to explosive climax)\n- Drums (heartbeat of ambition)\n\n### **VOCAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Range: A3-E6 (Soprano with strong belt)\n- Style: Contemporary MT with folk influences\n- Emotional arc: Vulnerable to ruthless to triumphant\n- Polish accent softening as she transforms\n\n### **KEY CHANGES:**\n- Verse 1: Em (minor, uncertain)\n- Chorus 1: G major (hopeful ambition)\n- Bridge: Bb major (justification)\n- Final Chorus: C major (triumphant decision)\n\n---\n\n## STAGING NOTES\n\n### **BLOCKING:**\n- Begins seated at vanity, practicing in mirror\n- Gradual standing and movement during chorus\n- Bridge: pacing like a caged animal\n- Final verse: applying makeup like armor\n- Ends facing audience, transformed\n\n### **LIGHTING:**\n- Single spot on vanity mirror\n- Gradual brightening as ambition builds\n- Harsh white light for final decision\n- Red lipstick moment in sharp focus\n\n---\n\n## CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SERVED\n\n**CANDY'S ARC:**\n- From grateful protégé to ruthless competitor\n- From family loyalty to individual survival\n- From Candace Kowalski to Candy Cane\n- From victim of circumstances to agent of her own destiny\n\n**MORAL COMPLEXITY:**\n- Her reasons are understandable (supporting family)\n- Her methods are questionable (betraying mentors)\n- Her choice is both selfish and selfless\n- Her transformation is both triumph and tragedy\n\n---\n\n## TRANSCENDENT ELEMENTS\n\n**CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY:** Polish working-class background drives her choices\n**ECONOMIC REALITY:** Poverty and family obligation motivate betrayal\n**MORAL COMPLEXITY:** No clear right or wrong, just survival\n**CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE:** Gig economy, loyalty vs. opportunity\n**MUSICAL INTEGRATION:** Song advances plot while revealing psychology\n\n**THIS SONG MAKES THE AUDIENCE:**\n- **SWEAT** with the intensity of her ambition\n- **CRY** for the family she's abandoning\n- **SWOON** over her determination and beauty\n- **LAUGH** at her brutal honesty about survival\n- **GRIN** at her fierce refusal to stay small\n- **ANGUISH** over the cost of her dreams\n\nCandy becomes a complex anti-hero -
