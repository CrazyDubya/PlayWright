**Kingdom**: The Moonlit Realm, sister kingdom to where Rainbow Academy now stands\n- **Family**: King Cosmos and Queen Nebula, loving but distant rulers\n- **Personality**: Sensitive, artistic, preferred books and stargazing to sword fighting\n- **Problem**: Didn't fit the \"traditional prince\" mold his kingdom expected\n\n### **Arrival at Rainbow Academy (Age 15)**\n- **Reason**: Sent to learn \"proper princely behavior\" and make royal connections\n- **Unicorn Partner**: Shadowmere, a rare dark unicorn (not evil, just different)\n- **Academic Performance**: Brilliant at magic theory, struggled with practical applications\n- **Social Status**: Outsider due to his quiet, introspective nature\n\n### **The Rejection That Changed Everything**\n- **The Incident**: During the Academy's Grand Ball, Obsidian was publicly humiliated\n- **What Happened**: Other students mocked his \"weird\" interests and dark unicorn\n- **The Cruelty**: Princess Celestia (Ruby's ancestor) led the mockery, calling him \"Shadow Boy\"\n- **The Breaking Point**: Shadowmere was injured trying to protect Obsidian from magical pranks\n- **The Choice**: Obsidian chose revenge over healing, darkness over light\n\n### **The Fall to Darkness**\n- **The Bargain**: Made a deal with ancient dark magic to gain power\n- **The Price**: His ability to feel love, joy, or connection was slowly drained away\n- **The Transformation**: Became the Shadow Weaver, feeding on others' fears and doubts\n- **The Exile**: Banished from the academy, his kingdom fell to darkness shortly after\n- **The Curse**:
