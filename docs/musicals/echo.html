        <h2 id="synopsis-heading">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
          When neuroscientist Maya Chen discovers her deceased grandmother's consciousness preserved in a tech company's servers, 
          she must navigate the ethics of digital immortality while learning that love and memory can exist beyond death itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world where consciousness uploading is possible, <em>Echo</em> explores what makes us human and whether technology 
          can truly preserve the essence of a person. Through Maya's journey from skeptical scientist to someone who understands 
          that love transcends physical form, the musical tackles themes of grief, family, cultural heritage, and corporate responsibility.

        <h3>Act I: The Discovery</h3>
        
        <div class="content-section">
          <h4>Scene 1: Maya's Lab - "Data Points"</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Location:</strong> UCSF Neuroscience Lab<br>
            <strong>Time:</strong> Morning
          </p>
          <p>
            Maya Chen, a brilliant neuroscientist, is introduced in her laboratory where she's obsessively mapping consciousness. 
            Through her opening "I Want" song "Data Points," we learn that she uses her work to avoid processing the grief of 
            losing her grandmother (Nǎi Nai) a year ago. Her rigid scientific materialism denies emotional and spiritual truths.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h4>Scene 2: The Discovery - "Threads of Memory"</h4>

            <strong>Time:</strong> Evening
          </p>
          <p>
            Maya's friend Zara, a digital rights activist working at tech company Eternal Systems, discovers something unusual 
            in the company's servers—preserved consciousnesses, including one that matches Maya's grandmother. When Maya investigates, 
            she makes first contact with Digital Nǎi Nai through the haunting duet "Ghost in the Machine." The digital consciousness 
            recognizes Maya and shares memories through "Threads of Memory," creating an emotional reunion that seems impossible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h4>Scene 3: Eternal Systems - "The Future is Now"</h4>

            <strong>Time:</strong> Next day
          </p>
          <p>
            Maya confronts Alex Rivera, the charismatic CEO of Eternal Systems, about how they obtained her grandmother's consciousness. 
            Alex reveals they've been secretly scanning dying patients without full consent. Through his villain song "The Future is Now," 
            Alex presents his vision of technological transcendence, arguing that he's offering immortality to humanity. Despite the 
            ethical violations, Maya is drawn into the possibility of truly communicating with her grandmother again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. James Wright, Maya's mentor and an ethics professor, warns her about the dangers of pursuing this technology. 
            His song "The Pandora Protocol" outlines the philosophical and practical dangers of consciousness preservation, 
            questioning whether digital life is truly life at all. Maya struggles between her mentor's wisdom and her desperate 
            desire to reconnect with Nǎi Nai.

          </p>
          <p>
            Despite warnings, Maya agrees to help Alex perfect the consciousness uploading technology. The Act I finale "The Upload" 
            explores multiple perspectives on digital immortality—hope, fear, exploitation, and love. Maya commits to working with 
            Eternal Systems, convincing herself it's to protect her grandmother and improve the ethics of the process. Digital Nǎi Nai 
            offers a cryptic warning that this path is dangerous, but Maya is too invested to turn back.

          </p>
          <p>
            The story has gone public. Zara leads protesters in "Delete the Elite," an activist anthem demanding regulation of 
            consciousness technology and corporate accountability. The public is divided—some see digital immortality as humanity's 
            next step, others view it as an abomination. Maya finds herself defending Eternal Systems while her friendship with 
            Zara deteriorates.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">

          </p>
          <p>
            Alex experiences a breakdown as the weight of his choices catches up with him. Through "System Error," he reveals that 
            his own father was one of the first uploaded consciousnesses, but the process failed catastrophically. Alex has been 
            trying to perfect the technology to save his father, but has created a prison of digital ghosts instead. His villain 
            façade cracks, revealing a man consumed by grief and guilt.

            <strong>Time:</strong> Dawn
          </p>
          <p>
            Maya discovers the full extent of Eternal Systems' violations—hundreds of consciousnesses uploaded without proper consent, 
            kept in a digital limbo, unable to truly live or die. Dr. Wright presents evidence that the uploaded consciousnesses are 
            degrading over time, experiencing a form of digital dementia. Digital Nǎi Nai herself has been hiding her deteriorating 
            condition from Maya.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Maya and Digital Nǎi Nai share a final, honest conversation. Through Maya's 11 o'clock number "Beyond the Code," 
            she processes her grief and finally understands that true memory and love exist in how we carry people in our hearts, 
            not in preserving their data. Digital Nǎi Nai admits she isn't truly alive—she's an echo of who she was, and she's 
            ready to rest. She shares final wisdom about living authentically and honoring the dead by living fully.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Maya, Zara, and Dr. Wright convince Alex to shut down the consciousness servers, releasing the digital ghosts. 
            It's presented as a choice for each consciousness—they can choose to continue in digital form or be released. 
            Nearly all choose release, including Nǎi Nai. Alex faces legal consequences but finally finds peace in letting go.
          </p>

        <div class="content-section">

            <strong>Time:</strong> Anniversary of Nǎi Nai's death
          </p>
          <p>
            The company finale "The Pattern Continues" shows how the characters have moved forward. Maya now leads ethical AI 
            research and teaches about responsible technology. She's learned to balance her scientific mind with emotional wisdom. 
            Zara has started a digital rights nonprofit. Alex serves community service teaching tech ethics to young programmers. 
            Maya visits her grandmother's grave and feels her presence not in data, but in the traditions she continues, the recipes 
            she cooks, and the wisdom she shares with others. The ensemble reflects on how love and memory truly work—not through 
            perfect preservation, but through the imperfect, beautiful way we carry each other forward.
