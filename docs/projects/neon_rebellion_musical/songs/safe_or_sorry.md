## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Zara, defending safety and order)
```
ZARA:
You call it freedom, I call it chaos
You call it truth, I call it lies
You're asking me to throw away
Everything I've built, everything I've tried

I have a future, I have a plan
I have a life that makes sense
Why would I risk it all for this
For your dangerous pretense?

Safe is smart, safe is sane
Safe means I won't lose everything
Sorry, but I can't afford
To gamble on what rebellion brings
```

### Verse 2 (Riot, challenging her worldview)
```
RIOT:
You call it safety, I call it prison
You call it smart, I call it fear
You're asking me to understand
Why you'd choose chains when freedom's here

You have a future that's not your own
You have a plan that's not your choice
You have a life that's killing your soul
While silencing your voice

Sorry, but safe is just another word
For giving up before you start
Safe is what they want you to choose
When you're afraid to follow your heart
```

### Chorus 1 (Both, arguing their positions)
```
ZARA:
Safe or sorry, that's the choice
Safe or sorry, I know which one's wise

RIOT:
Safe or sorry, that's the choice
Safe or sorry, but safe is just disguise

ZARA:
For cowardice and foolish dreams

RIOT:
For living life the way it seems

BOTH:
You're supposed to live
But what if there's more to give?

ZARA:
I'd rather be safe than sorry

RIOT:
I'd rather be sorry than safe
```

### Bridge (Zara, revealing her deeper fears)
```
ZARA:
You don't understand what I could lose
My father's love, my family's pride
My future, my security
Everything I am inside

What if I try and I fail?
What if I'm not who you think?
What if I jump and there's nothing there
And I fall into the drink?

I've worked so hard to be perfect
I've sacrificed so much to succeed
How can you ask me to throw it away
For something I might not even need?
```

### Bridge (Riot, revealing his understanding)
```
RIOT:
I understand more than you know
I had everything you think you want
A perfect life, a perfect future
A perfect family to flaunt

But perfect is just another cage
With golden bars and silver locks
And when you're dying inside that cage
The beauty of it mocks

Everything you could have been
Everything you'll never be
If you choose safety over truth
You'll never be free
```

### Final Chorus (Both, with growing intensity)
```
ZARA:
Safe or sorry, I choose safe
Even if it means I'll never know

RIOT:
Safe or sorry, I choose sorry
Even if it means I'll have to go

ZARA:
Through life wondering what if

RIOT:
Through life knowing what is

BOTH:
Real and true and worth the risk
Worth the pain, worth the fight

ZARA:
But I can't see beyond the fear

RIOT:
But I can't live without the light

ZARA:
I'd rather be safe than sorry

RIOT:
I'd rather be sorry than safe

BOTH:
And maybe that's the difference
Between a life that's real
And a life that's just... safe
```

### Outro (Unresolved, both questioning)
```
ZARA:
(Quietly, to herself)
But what if safe isn't really safe at all?

RIOT:
(Quietly, to himself)
And what if sorry is too high a price to pay?

BOTH:
(Looking at each other)
Safe or sorry...
Safe or sorry...
Which way leads to who I'm meant to be?
```
