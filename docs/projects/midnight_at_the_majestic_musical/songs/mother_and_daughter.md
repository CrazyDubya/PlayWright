## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - RECOGNITION (Ruby, barely breathing)**

**RUBY** (Polish folk melody, broken and fragile):
*In Polish, then English*
*Matka... czy to naprawdę ty?* (Mother... is it really you?)
*Twenty-three years*
*I've dreamed this moment*
*Imagined your face*
*Your voice*
*Your reasons*

*But in my dreams*
*You came back*
*Because you loved me*
*Not because*
*You killed someone*

### **VERSE 1 RESPONSE - JUSTIFICATION (Katarzyna, defensive)**

**KATARZYNA** (Same melody, but harder, more desperate):
*In Polish, then English*
*Córeczko, nie rozumiesz* (Little daughter, you don't understand)
*Everything I did*
*Was to protect you*
*To save you*
*From this life*
*From these choices*

*I killed her*
*Yes*
*But I killed her*
*To set you free*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE DIVIDE**

**RUBY** (Building anger):
*You don't get to call me daughter*
*You don't get to claim that love*
*You left me*
*You abandoned me*
*You chose strangers*
*Over your own blood*

**KATARZYNA** (Overlapping, desperate):
*I chose to save lives*
*I chose to matter*
*I chose to make*
*Your sacrifice*
*Mean something*

**BOTH** (Harmony, but discordant):
*We are strangers*
*Bound by blood*
*We are enemies*
*Bound by love*
*We are broken*
*By the choices*
*Survival demands*

### **VERSE 2 - THE ACCUSATION (Ruby, fury building)**

**RUBY** (Tempo increasing, anger rising):
*You want to know*
*What your "protection" cost?*
*Twenty-three years*
*Of wondering*
*Why I wasn't enough*
*Why I wasn't worth*
*Staying for*

*Twenty-three years*
*Of believing*
*I was unlovable*
*Unwanted*
*Disposable*
*Because my own mother*
*Threw me away*

### **VERSE 2 RESPONSE - THE DEFENSE (Katarzyna, breaking)**

**KATARZYNA** (Voice cracking, but determined):
*You think I wanted*
*To leave you?*
*You think it was easy*
*To walk away*
*From the only thing*
*That mattered?*

*Every night*
*For twenty-three years*
*I've seen your face*
*Heard your voice*
*Calling for mama*
*And I couldn't answer*
*Because answering*
*Would have killed you*

### **BRIDGE - THE TRUTH (Both, building to explosion)**

**RUBY** (Rapid-fire, desperate):
*Tell me about the others*
*Tell me about the families*
*You saved*
*While you destroyed*
*Your own*

**KATARZYNA** (Overlapping):
*Hundreds of lives*
*Hundreds of children*
*Who got to grow up*
*Free*
*Safe*
*Because I chose*
*Their future*
*Over my present*

**RUBY** (Screaming):
*WHAT ABOUT MY FUTURE?*
*WHAT ABOUT MY SAFETY?*
*WHAT ABOUT MY CHOICE?*

**KATARZYNA** (Screaming back):
*YOU WERE FIVE YEARS OLD!*
*YOU COULDN'T CHOOSE!*
*I HAD TO CHOOSE FOR YOU!*

### **VERSE 3 - THE BREAKDOWN (Ruby, voice breaking)**

**RUBY** (Slower, more painful):
*Do you know*
*What it's like*
*To grow up*
*Believing*
*You're not worth*
*Fighting for?*

*Do you know*
*What it's like*
*To change your name*
*Your voice*
*Your soul*
*Trying to become*
*Someone*
*Worth loving?*

*I became Ruby Fontaine*
*Because Róża Kowalski*
*Wasn't enough*
*To make her mother*
*Stay*

### **VERSE 3 RESPONSE - THE CONFESSION (Katarzyna, completely broken)**

**KATARZYNA** (Barely audible, then building):
*Do you know*
*What it's like*
*To hold your child*
*For the last time*
*Knowing*
*You'll never*
*Hold her again?*

*Do you know*
*What it's like*
*To choose*
*Between*
*Your heart*
*And your conscience*
*And lose*
*Both?*

*I didn't leave*
*Because you weren't enough*
*I left*
*Because you were*
*Everything*
*And I couldn't*
*Let them*
*Destroy you*
*Too*

### **CHORUS 2 - THE RECOGNITION (Both, harmony but still painful)**

**RUBY** (Understanding but not forgiving):
*I see your pain*
*I see your choice*
*I see the weight*
*You've carried*

**KATARZYNA** (Grateful but still guilty):
*I see your hurt*
*I see your strength*
*I see the woman*
*You became*
*Without me*

**BOTH** (Together, but still apart):
*We are strangers*
*Bound by blood*
*We are broken*
*By the choices*
*Love demands*

*But understanding*
*Isn't forgiveness*
*And forgiveness*
*Isn't love*
*And love*
*Isn't enough*
*To heal*
*What's been*
*Destroyed*

### **FINAL VERSE - THE CHOICE (Ruby, with terrible clarity)**

**RUBY** (Slow, deliberate, final):
*I understand*
*Why you left*
*I understand*
*Why you killed*
*I understand*
*The impossible*
*Choices*
*You faced*

*But understanding*
*Doesn't erase*
*Twenty-three years*
*Of abandonment*
*Doesn't heal*
*A broken child*
*Doesn't make*
*A stranger*
*Into a mother*

*You saved hundreds*
*But you lost*
*Me*
*And I*
*Can't pretend*
*That's okay*
*Just because*
*It was noble*

### **OUTRO - THE FAREWELL (Both, quiet devastation)**

**KATARZYNA** (Whispered):
*Córeczko...*

**RUBY** (Firm but not cruel):
*My name*
*Is Ruby*
*Ruby Fontaine*
*The woman*
*I became*
*Without you*

*And she*
*Doesn't need*
*A mother*
*Who comes*
*With blood*
*On her hands*

**KATARZYNA** (Final acceptance):
*Then I'll go*
*Back to the shadows*
*Back to the work*
*Back to saving*
*Other people's*
*Children*

*Since I couldn't*
*Save*
*My own*

*(Music fades to silence)*

## CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SERVED

**RUBY**: Chooses self-preservation over forgiveness, authenticity over reconciliation
**KATARZYNA**: Accepts the cost of her choices, the loss of her daughter
**THE RELATIONSHIP**: Defined by understanding without forgiveness, love without reunion

---

## TRANSCENDENT ELEMENTS

**CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY**: Polish folk melodies and language honor their heritage
**PERSONAL TRAUMA**: Every line serves emotional truth, not plot advancement
**MORAL COMPLEXITY**: Both are right, both are wrong, both are broken
**MUSICAL INTEGRATION**: Song structure mirrors emotional journey
**CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE**: Immigration, family separation, impossible choices

**THIS IS THE EMOTIONAL HEART OF THE MUSICAL** - where love and abandonment, sacrifice and selfishness, understanding and forgiveness collide in the most human way possible.

Ruby's choice to walk away isn't cruelty - it's survival. And that choice honors both women's strength.
