**SETTING:** The theater is empty. The company has been taken away. FRANK stands alone on the stage where it all began, his world completely shattered. The clock strikes midnight.

## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE EMPTINESS**

**FRANK** (Alone, Irish folk melody, sparse accompaniment):
*The theater's empty now*
*The voices silenced*
*The songs cut short*
*By the weight*
*Of the law*

*I came here*
*Looking for a killer*
*I found*
*A family*
*I came here*
*Seeking justice*
*I found*
*Only questions*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE DOUBT**

**FRANK** (Building slightly):
*What is justice*
*When the law*
*Destroys the innocent?*
*What is right*
*When doing right*
*Feels so wrong?*

*I swore an oath*
*To serve and protect*
*But who*
*Am I protecting*
*And from what?*

### **VERSE 2 - THE REVELATION**

**FRANK** (Melody from "Opening Night" theme):
*They sang their songs*
*In languages*
*I don't understand*
*But I understood*
*The music*
*I understood*
*The love*

*Ruby chose*
*Deportation*
*Over betrayal*
*Helena faced*
*Her past*
*Tommy embraced*
*His truth*
*They chose*
*Each other*
*Over safety*

### **BRIDGE - THE SYSTEM**

**FRANK** (Tempo slowing, more introspective):
*My brother Danny*
*Is alive*
*Running the same*
*Operation*
*In Boston*
*Saving lives*
*Breaking laws*

*My uncle*
*The captain*
*Taking bribes*
*To look away*
*From deportation raids*
*Corrupt*
*But maybe*
*Right*

*And me?*
*Standing here*
*With my badge*
*And my oath*
*And my certainty*
*All crumbling*
*Like sand*

### **CHORUS 2 - THE CHOICE**

**FRANK** (Quiet desperation):
*What is justice*
*When the system*
*Is the crime?*
*What is law*
*When the law*
*Serves hatred*
*More than hope?*

*I could report*
*What I found*
*Destroy the network*
*Follow procedure*
*Do my job*

*Or I could*
*Walk away*
*Forget*
*What I learned*
*Let the underground*
*Continue*
*Its work*

### **FINAL VERSE - THE DECISION**

**FRANK** (With quiet resolution):
*Vivian Sterling*
*Is still dead*
*Katarzyna Kowalski*
*Still killed her*
*That's a fact*
*That won't change*

*But the why*
*The how*
*The cost*
*Of survival*
*In a country*
*That promises*
*Freedom*
*But delivers*
*Fear*

*That changes*
*Everything*

### **OUTRO - THE MIDNIGHT HOUR**

**FRANK** (Speaking, then singing softly):
*(Speaking)*
*The clock strikes midnight*
*October 13th becomes*
*October 14th*
*A new day*

*(Singing)*
*I'll file my report*
*In the morning*
*I'll write*
*"Case closed"*
*"Suspect fled"*
*"No leads"*

*And somewhere*
*In Boston*
*My brother Danny*
*Will get a call*
*Warning him*
*To be careful*
*To move*
*The operation*
*To keep*
*Saving lives*

*Because sometimes*
*Justice*
*Isn't about*
*The law*
*Sometimes*
*Justice*
*Is about*
*Love*

*And I choose*
*Love*

*(Music fades to silence)*

## CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT COMPLETED

**FRANK'S ARC:**
- From certainty to doubt
- From law to justice
- From individual to community
- From system servant to moral agent

**THE FINAL CHOICE:**
Frank chooses to protect the underground railroad, warning his brother, filing a false report. He chooses love over law, humanity over procedure.

---

## THEMATIC RESOLUTION

**JUSTICE VS. LAW:** Sometimes they're opposites
**INDIVIDUAL VS. SYSTEM:** One person can choose differently
**LOVE VS. FEAR:** Love wins, quietly, without fanfare
**TRUTH VS. SAFETY:** Truth doesn't always triumph, but love does

**THE TRANSCENDENT ENDING:**
No easy answers, no false hope, no systematic resolution. Just one man choosing love over law in a broken system. The underground railroad continues. The displaced remain displaced. But love persists.

**MIDNIGHT AT THE MAJESTIC IS COMPLETE** - 9 songs that transform a murder mystery into a meditation on love, survival, and the cost of being human in an inhuman system.

This is transcendent musical theater - where broken systematic perfection reveals bleeding human truth.
