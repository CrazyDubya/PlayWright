# "THE CHOICE"
## Act II, Song 7 - Ruby's Decision Solo

**SETTING:** Ruby stands alone after her mother's departure. The FBI waits. Frank waits. Everyone waits for her decision - cooperate and stay American, or refuse and face deportation.

**STYLE:** Powerful solo ballad building from vulnerability to strength. Polish folk influences merging with contemporary musical theater.

## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE WEIGHT**

**RUBY** (Quiet, contemplative):
*Standing here*
*Between two worlds*
*Between two names*
*Between two lives*
*I never chose*

*Ruby Fontaine*
*Was born from fear*
*From the need*
*To disappear*
*Into America's dream*
*Of who I should be*

*But Róża Kowalski*
*Was born from love*
*From a mother's hands*
*From a father's songs*
*From a heritage*
*I was taught*
*To forget*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE REALIZATION**

**RUBY** (Building):
*Who am I*
*When the masks*
*Fall away?*
*Who am I*
*When the lies*
*Can't protect me?*

*Am I the girl*
*Who hides*
*Who runs*
*Who changes*
*To survive?*
*Or am I*
*The woman*
*Who stands*
*Who fights*
*Who chooses*
*Love over fear?*

### **VERSE 2 - THE FAMILY**

**RUBY** (Looking at the company):
*Tommy*
*Dancing through*
*His father's hatred*
*Helena*
*Carrying*
*Her daughter's ghost*
*Jonathan*
*Building new life*
*From old ashes*

*Maggie*
*Protecting*
*Her mother's secret*
*Eddie*
*Sacrificing*
*His daughter's future*
*For today's survival*

*These broken people*
*Became my family*
*When blood*
*Wasn't enough*

### **BRIDGE - THE UNDERSTANDING**

**RUBY** (Revelation building):
*My mother*
*Made her choice*
*Twenty-three years ago*
*She chose*
*The many*
*Over the one*
*The cause*
*Over the child*

*And I hated her*
*For that choice*
*But standing here*
*Facing the same*
*Impossible decision*
*I finally*
*Understand*

*Love*
*Isn't always*
*Staying*
*Sometimes*
*Love*
*Is letting go*
*Sometimes*
*Love*
*Is sacrifice*
*Sometimes*
*Love*
*Is choosing*
*What's right*
*Over what's*
*Easy*

### **CHORUS 2 - THE DECISION**

**RUBY** (Full voice, powerful):
*I know who I am*
*When the masks*
*Fall away*
*I know who I am*
*When the truth*
*Is all I have*

*I am Róża Kowalski*
*Daughter of immigrants*
*Child of survivors*
*Sister to the displaced*
*And I choose*
*My family*
*Over my safety*
*My truth*
*Over my comfort*
*My heritage*
*Over my fear*

### **FINAL VERSE - THE TRANSFORMATION**

**RUBY** (With absolute certainty):
*Ruby Fontaine*
*Was a beautiful lie*
*A necessary fiction*
*A survival strategy*
*But she was never*
*Real*

*Róża Kowalski*
*Is messy*
*Is complicated*
*Is dangerous*
*But she is*
*True*

*And I would rather*
*Be true*
*And deported*
*Than false*
*And free*

### **OUTRO - THE DECLARATION**

**RUBY** (Speaking to Agent Walsh, then singing):
*Agent Walsh*
*I will not*
*Cooperate*
*With your investigation*

*(Singing)*
*I choose*
*My family*
*I choose*
*My truth*
*I choose*
*To be*
*Róża Kowalski*
*Proud daughter*
*Of Poland*
*And America*
*Both*

*Send me back*
*If you must*
*But I will not*
*Betray*
*The people*
*Who saved me*
*When my own*
*Mother*
*Could not*
