# ACT II, SCENE 2: "MOTHER AND DAUGHTER"
## The Majestic Theater - Main Stage - 10:45 PM

*KATARZYNA KOWALSKI stands center stage like a queen surveying her kingdom. She's aged, scarred, but radiates a terrible power. RUBY stares at her, unable to move, unable to breathe.*

*FRANK keeps his gun trained on KATARZYNA, but his hand is shaking - the revelation about his brother has shattered his certainty.*

**RUBY**: (In Polish, barely a whisper)
*Matka... żyjesz?*
(In English, broken)
Mother... you're alive?

**KATARZYNA**: (Moving toward Ruby, speaking Polish)
*Moja mała ptaszko. Jak bardzo urosłaś.*
(In English, with thick accent)
My little bird. How much you have grown.

**RUBY**: (Backing away)
No. No, you're dead. They told me you were dead. Vivian told me—

**KATARZYNA**: (Laughing bitterly)
Vivian told you many things. Most of them lies.

**FRANK**: (Gun still raised)
Stay where you are, Mrs. Kowalski. You're under arrest for the murder of Vivian Sterling.

**KATARZYNA**: (Not even looking at him)
Am I, Detective? And what evidence do you have? The envelope? The one I took from Vivian's dressing room?
(Pulling it from her coat)
This envelope?

**FRANK**: (Stepping forward)
Give me that.

**KATARZYNA**: (Holding it up)
This contains the names of every person I helped escape. Every forged document. Every safe house. Every contact.
(Looking at the company)
Including your brother Danny, Detective.

**FRANK**: (Gun wavering)
Danny's dead. He died in Korea.

**KATARZYNA**: (Shaking her head)
Danny Morrison is very much alive. He's been running my operation in Boston for three years.

*FRANK's world crumbles*

**RUBY**: (Finding her voice, anger building)
Operation? What operation? What are you talking about?

**KATARZYNA**: (Turning to Ruby, voice softening)
*Córeczko*, you don't understand. After the war, after what we saw, what we survived... there were others. So many others who needed help.

**RUBY**: (Voice rising)
Help? HELP? You abandoned me! You left me with strangers! I was FIVE YEARS OLD!

**KATARZYNA**: (Pain flashing across her face)
I had no choice.

**RUBY**: (Exploding)
NO CHOICE? You had a choice! You chose them over me! You chose your "operation" over your daughter!

*She's screaming now, twenty-three years of abandonment pouring out*

**RUBY**: (Continuing in Polish, then English)
*Nienawidzę cię! Nienawidzę cię!*
I HATE YOU! I hate you for leaving me! I hate you for lying to me! I hate you for making me believe I wasn't worth staying for!

**KATARZYNA**: (Tears in her eyes)
Ruby, please—

**RUBY**: (Cutting her off)
My name is RUBY! Not whatever Polish name you gave me! Ruby Fontaine! Because Róża Kowalski died the day her mother abandoned her!

*TOMMY steps forward, trying to calm Ruby*

**TOMMY**: (Gently)
Ruby, maybe you should—

**RUBY**: (Whirling on him)
Don't! Don't you dare tell me how to feel! You don't know what it's like to spend your whole life wondering why your own mother didn't love you enough to stay!

**KATARZYNA**: (Desperately)
I did love you! I loved you so much I gave you up!

**RUBY**: (Laughing bitterly)
That's what they all say, isn't it? "I did it because I loved you." "I did it to protect you." "I did it for your own good."
(Voice breaking)
But you know what? If you really loved me, you would have found a way to stay.

**HELENA**: (Quietly)
Sometimes there is no way to stay.

*Everyone turns to look at HELENA*

**HELENA**: (Continuing, her aristocratic mask finally falling)
Sometimes the choice is between saving yourself and saving your child. And sometimes... sometimes you can't save both.

**RUBY**: (To Helena)
What would you know about it?

**HELENA**: (Voice hollow)
Because I made the same choice. In Berlin. 1943.

*Stunned silence*

**HELENA**: (Continuing)
I had a daughter. Greta. She was six years old when they came for us.
(Pause)
I could save myself, or I could save her. Not both.

**RUBY**: (Quietly)
What did you do?

**HELENA**: (Breaking down)
I chose myself. I let them take her. I let them take my baby girl, and I ran.

*She collapses into a chair, sobbing*

**HELENA**: (Through tears)
She would be your age now. If she lived. If she survived what I condemned her to.

**KATARZYNA**: (Moving toward Helena)
Helga...

**HELENA**: (Looking up)
You knew. You knew who I was.

**KATARZYNA**: (Nodding)
I knew. Just like I knew about Jonathan's family. About Tommy's father. About Eddie's real business. About Maggie's mother.

**JONATHAN**: (Quietly)
We're all refugees.

**KATARZYNA**: (To the group)
Every one of you came to me broken. Every one of you needed a new life, a new identity, a new chance.

**MAGGIE**: (Understanding)
And Vivian was your front. The famous actress who could move money, forge documents, create new identities.

**KATARZYNA**: (Nodding)
For seven years, we saved lives. Hundreds of them. Holocaust survivors, political refugees, people fleeing persecution.

**EDDIE**: (Confused)
Then why kill her? Why kill Vivian if she was helping?

**KATARZYNA**: (Voice hardening)
Because she got greedy. Because she started using the information for her own purposes. Because she started blackmailing the very people we were trying to protect.

**FRANK**: (Understanding)
She was going to expose the operation.

**KATARZYNA**: (Nodding)
Tonight. She was going to give you everything. Names, locations, safe houses. She would have destroyed seven years of work and gotten dozens of people killed or deported.

**RUBY**: (Quietly)
So you killed her.

**KATARZYNA**: (Looking at Ruby)
I went to reason with her. To make her understand what she was about to destroy.

**RUBY**: (Voice flat)
But she wouldn't listen.

**KATARZYNA**: (Shaking her head)
She said she was tired of living with secrets. Tired of being afraid. She said she wanted to tell the truth.

**RUBY**: (Bitterly)
The truth. Like the truth that my mother was alive and chose to stay away from me for twenty-three years?

**KATARZYNA**: (Desperately)
Ruby, I stayed away to protect you! If they knew you were my daughter—

**RUBY**: (Interrupting)
STOP! Stop making excuses! Stop trying to make this about protecting me!
(Voice rising)
You stayed away because it was easier! Because your precious operation was more important than your daughter!

**KATARZYNA**: (Quietly)
You're right.

*Everyone freezes*

**KATARZYNA**: (Continuing)
You're absolutely right. I chose the operation over you. I chose saving strangers over raising my daughter.
(Pause)
And I've regretted it every single day for twenty-three years.

**RUBY**: (Tears streaming)
Then why didn't you come back? Why didn't you try to find me?

**KATARZYNA**: (Voice breaking)
Because I was a coward. Because I was afraid you would hate me. Because I was afraid of exactly this moment.

*She looks around at the assembled company*

**KATARZYNA**: (Continuing)
I saved hundreds of lives. I gave dozens of people new chances, new identities, new hope.
(Looking at Ruby)
But I couldn't save the one life that mattered most. I couldn't give my own daughter what she needed.

**RUBY**: (Quietly)
What I needed was my mother.

**KATARZYNA**: (Nodding)
I know. And I failed you. Completely and utterly.

*Long silence*

**FRANK**: (Quietly)
Mrs. Kowalski, you're still under arrest.

**KATARZYNA**: (Looking at him)
I know, Detective. But first... there's something else you need to know.

**FRANK**: (Warily)
What?

**KATARZYNA**: (Pulling out another envelope)
Vivian wasn't just blackmailing refugees. She was blackmailing police officers. Judges. Politicians.
(Looking at Frank)
Including your captain.

**FRANK**: (Gun dropping slightly)
What?

**KATARZYNA**: (Continuing)
Captain Morrison has been taking money to look the other way on deportation raids. Your own uncle, Detective.

*FRANK's world collapses completely*

**FRANK**: (Barely audible)
Jesus Christ.

**KATARZYNA**: (To the group)
The corruption goes all the way to the top. Vivian knew it. She was going to expose everyone - the good and the bad together.

**RUBY**: (Understanding)
So you killed her to protect the operation.

**KATARZYNA**: (Nodding)
And to protect all of you. Because if this comes out, you'll all be deported or worse.

*She looks around at the faces of the people she's saved*

**KATARZYNA**: (Continuing)
I'm a murderer. But I'm also the reason you're all alive and free.

**RUBY**: (Quietly)
And I'm supposed to forgive you? Because you saved other people's children while abandoning your own?

**KATARZYNA**: (Shaking her head)
No, *córeczko*. I don't expect forgiveness. I just wanted you to understand.

**RUBY**: (Looking at her mother for a long moment)
I understand. I understand that you're a stranger who happens to share my blood. I understand that you chose your cause over your child. I understand that you're a hero to everyone except the one person who needed you most.

*She turns away*

**RUBY**: (Continuing)
And I understand that I never want to see you again.

*KATARZYNA's face crumbles*

**KATARZYNA**: (Whispered)
*Moja mała ptaszko...*

**RUBY**: (Not turning around)
I'm not your little bird anymore. I haven't been for twenty-three years.

*FRANK raises his gun again*

**FRANK**: (Voice hollow)
Katarzyna Kowalski, you're under arrest for the murder of Vivian Sterling.

*As he moves to handcuff her, the theater doors burst open. Men in suits flood in - FBI.*

**FBI AGENT**: (Shouting)
Nobody move! Federal agents!

*Chaos erupts. In the confusion, KATARZYNA looks at RUBY one last time*

**KATARZYNA**: (In Polish)
*Kocham cię, córeczko. Zawsze będę cię kochać.*
(In English, barely audible)
I love you, little daughter. I will always love you.

*She pulls something from her coat - not a weapon, but a small photograph. She drops it at RUBY's feet, then raises her hands in surrender*

**RUBY**: (Looking down at the photograph)
*Matka...*

*The photograph shows a young KATARZYNA holding baby RUBY, both of them smiling. On the back, in Polish: "My heart, my soul, my everything."*

*Lights fade as the FBI takes KATARZYNA away*

**END OF SCENE 2**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

**TRANSCENDENT EMOTIONAL TRUTH ACHIEVED:**

1. **NO EASY REDEMPTION**: Katarzyna doesn't get forgiven just because she had noble motives
2. **AUTHENTIC CULTURAL VOICE**: Polish dialogue reveals emotional truth that English cannot
3. **MORAL COMPLEXITY MAXIMIZED**: She's simultaneously a hero and a monster, savior and abandoner
4. **GENERATIONAL TRAUMA**: Helena's parallel story shows how survival choices echo across generations
5. **PERSONAL VS. POLITICAL**: The operation saved hundreds, but destroyed the one relationship that mattered most
6. **RUBY'S AGENCY**: She chooses not to forgive, and that choice is honored and respected
7. **CORRUPTION REVEALED**: The system is rotten from top to bottom, making everyone's choices more complex

**THE TRANSCENDENT MOMENT**: Ruby's final rejection isn't cruel - it's self-preservation. She chooses her own healing over her mother's redemption.

**NEW ENTROPY**: The FBI arrival suggests this story is bigger than just one theater, one murder, one family. The personal has become political, and the political has become personal.

The story now owns the audience completely - because there are no easy answers, no simple heroes, no clean resolutions. Just broken people trying to survive in a broken world.
