# ACT II, SCENE 1: "THE INTERROGATION"
## The Majestic Theater - Main Stage - 10:30 PM

*The theater has been transformed into a crime scene. FRANK has set up makeshift interrogation areas using the set pieces from "Midnight Serenade." The company sits in the orchestra seats like suspects in a lineup. The body has been removed, but the dressing room is sealed with police tape.*

*FRANK paces the stage like a predator. His Irish accent is thicker now - stress and anger bringing out his working-class roots.*

**FRANK**: (To the assembled company)
Alright, listen up. Vivian Sterling is dead. Murdered. And one of you killed her.
(Pause)
Now, I could wait for the boys from downtown to show up with their fancy equipment and their college degrees. But I've been doing this for twenty years, and I know when someone's lying to me.

*He stops pacing, looks at each face*

**FRANK**: (Continuing)
So we're going to do this the old-fashioned way. One by one. Until somebody tells me the truth.

**RUBY**: (Barely audible, still in shock)
Detective Morrison... I don't understand. Who would want to hurt Vivian?

**FRANK**: (Studying her reaction)
That's what we're going to find out, Miss... Fontaine, was it?
(Pause)
Or should I say Miss Kowalski?

*RUBY goes white. The others look confused.*

**RUBY**: (In Polish, whispered)
*Jak on wie?*
(In English)
How do you...?

**FRANK**: (Moving closer)
How do I know your real name? Because I've been investigating your mother's disappearance for three years.

*Stunned silence*

**RUBY**: (Standing, shaking)
My mother? My mother abandoned me when I was five. She went back to Poland.

**FRANK**: (Gently but firmly)
No, Ruby. She didn't. Your mother, Katarzyna Kowalski, was murdered in 1949. Her body was found in the East River with her throat cut.

*RUBY collapses back into her seat. TOMMY moves to comfort her.*

**TOMMY**: (To Frank)
Jesus Christ, you couldn't have broken that to her easier?

**FRANK**: (Turning on Tommy)
And you are?

**TOMMY**: (Defensive)
Tommy Rossini. I'm just a dancer.

**FRANK**: (Checking his notes)
Tommaso Giuseppe Rossini. Age 24. Three arrests for public indecency. Two for solicitation.

**TOMMY**: (Flushing red)
Those charges were dropped.

**FRANK**: (Relentless)
Because someone paid to have them dropped. Someone with connections. Someone like Vivian Sterling.

*TOMMY looks trapped*

**HELENA**: (Standing, imperious)
Detective, surely you don't suspect this boy of murder? He's barely more than a child.

**FRANK**: (Turning to Helena)
And you're Helena Worthington. Born Helga Württemberg in Munich, 1894. Entered the United States illegally in 1947 using forged papers.

**HELENA**: (Her composure cracking)
That's... that's not...

**FRANK**: (Continuing)
Your real papers were destroyed when you fled Germany. The question is: what were you running from?

**JONATHAN**: (Standing, agitated)
This is outrageous! You can't just accuse people based on—

**FRANK**: (Whirling on him)
Based on what, Mr. Blackwood? Or should I call you Yonatan Schwarzberg?

*JONATHAN freezes*

**FRANK**: (Continuing)
Yeah, I know about that too. Amazing what you can find out when you start digging. Immigration records, ship manifests, Ellis Island documentation.

**EDDIE**: (Sweating profusely)
Look, Detective, we all got our secrets, okay? That don't make us killers.

**FRANK**: (Moving to Eddie)
Eduardo Torrino. Your family grocery store burned down in 1948. Insurance fire, they said. But the investigator noted accelerant patterns consistent with arson.

**EDDIE**: (Panicking)
That was an accident! A grease fire! I got the papers to prove it!

**FRANK**: (Coldly)
Papers can be forged, Mr. Torrino. Just like the ones you used to get your daughter into that fancy private school.

*EDDIE looks like he's about to have a heart attack*

**MAGGIE**: (Standing, trying to take control)
Detective Morrison, this is getting us nowhere. We're all upset about Vivian, but—

**FRANK**: (Cutting her off)
Margaret Chen. Or should I say Chen Mei-Ling? Your father's laundry business is a front for smuggling Chinese nationals into the country. Your mother's marriage to your father is bigamous - she's still married to a man in Taishan.

*MAGGIE's composure finally cracks*

**MAGGIE**: (In Taishanese, then English)
*Nei dim ji?* How do you know this?

**FRANK**: (Triumphant)
Because Vivian Sterling knew all of it. Every secret. Every lie. Every crime. And she's been documenting it for years.

*He pulls out a photograph - one that wasn't in the stolen envelope*

**FRANK**: (Continuing)
This was hidden in her makeup case. It shows all of you at a meeting in 1949. The same year Ruby's mother was murdered.

*The photograph shows the entire company in what appears to be a clandestine meeting*

**RUBY**: (Looking at the photo, horrified)
That's... that's my mother. In the background.

**FRANK**: (Nodding)
Katarzyna Kowalski was investigating a human trafficking ring. She got too close to the truth. So someone killed her.

**HELENA**: (Quietly)
And Vivian knew.

**FRANK**: (To Helena)
Vivian knew everything. About the trafficking ring. About the forged papers. About the bribes and the murders and the cover-ups.

**JONATHAN**: (Desperately)
But why? Why would she keep such secrets?

**FRANK**: (Looking at all of them)
Because she was part of it. You all were. The question is: which one of you decided she'd become too dangerous to keep alive?

*Long silence. The weight of the truth settles over them.*

**TOMMY**: (Quietly)
We were just trying to survive.

**FRANK**: (Turning to him)
Survive what?

**TOMMY**: (Breaking down)
The raids. The deportations. The... the camps.

**HELENA**: (Sharply)
Tommy, don't.

**TOMMY**: (Continuing, tears streaming)
They were rounding up people like us. Queers, immigrants, anyone who didn't fit. Vivian... she helped us. She gave us new identities, new papers, new lives.

**FRANK**: (Understanding dawning)
In exchange for what?

**RUBY**: (Quietly)
Silence.

**FRANK**: (To Ruby)
About what?

**RUBY**: (Looking at the photo)
About who was really running the operation.

*She points to a figure in the background of the photograph - someone we haven't seen clearly before*

**RUBY**: (Continuing)
About who killed my mother when she found out the truth.

*FRANK looks at the photo, then at the assembled company. His face changes.*

**FRANK**: (Realizing)
Jesus Christ. It's not one of you, is it?

**MAGGIE**: (Quietly)
No, Detective. It's not.

**FRANK**: (Looking around the theater)
They're still here. In this theater. Right now.

*Sound of footsteps from the balcony. Everyone looks up.*

**VOICE FROM BALCONY**: (Familiar, but we can't place it)
Very good, Detective Morrison. You always were too smart for your own good.

*A figure emerges from the shadows of the balcony. It's someone we've seen before, but not as a suspect.*

**FRANK**: (Drawing his gun)
Come down here. Slowly.

**VOICE**: (Laughing)
Oh, Frank. You still don't understand, do you? This goes so much deeper than you think.

*The figure starts down the stairs, still in shadow*

**VOICE**: (Continuing)
Vivian Sterling wasn't just keeping secrets. She was keeping evidence. Evidence that could destroy some very important people.

**FRANK**: (Gun trained on the figure)
What people?

**VOICE**: (Now at the bottom of the stairs, stepping into the light)
People like your brother Danny, for instance.

*FRANK's gun wavers. The figure steps fully into the light.*

**FRANK**: (Shocked)
You're supposed to be dead.

**FIGURE**: (Smiling coldly)
Death is just another performance, Detective. And I've been giving the performance of my life.

*The figure is revealed - and it changes everything we thought we knew about this case*

**RUBY**: (Gasping)
*Matka?*

*The figure is KATARZYNA KOWALSKI - Ruby's mother, very much alive*

**KATARZYNA**: (In Polish-accented English)
Hello, my little bird. Did you miss me?

*Lights snap to black as thunder crashes*

**END OF SCENE 1**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

**NEW ENTROPY EXPLOSION:**

1. **SYSTEMATIC REVELATION**: Frank doesn't just question suspects - he systematically destroys their false identities
2. **THE REAL CONSPIRACY**: Not just individual secrets, but a human trafficking/identity forgery ring
3. **MORAL COMPLEXITY DEEPENED**: They weren't criminals - they were survivors helping other survivors
4. **THE TWIST**: Ruby's "dead" mother is alive and apparently the real mastermind
5. **FRANK'S PERSONAL STAKES**: His brother Danny is somehow involved
6. **VICTIM BECOMES PERPETRATOR**: Katarzyna, the supposed murder victim, is revealed as the killer

**CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY UNDER PRESSURE**: Each character's true background emerges under interrogation, showing how they've all been hiding their authentic selves for survival.

**THE TRANSCENDENT MOMENT**: Ruby's whispered "*Matka?*" (Mother?) - the recognition, the betrayal, the impossible hope and terror all in one word.

This isn't just a murder mystery anymore - it's a story about survival, identity, and the price of keeping secrets in 1950s America.
