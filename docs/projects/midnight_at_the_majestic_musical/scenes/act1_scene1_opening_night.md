# ACT I, SCENE 1: "OPENING NIGHT"
## The Majestic Theater - October 13th, 1952, 7:15 PM

*The curtain rises on the backstage chaos of opening night. The Majestic Theater's backstage area is revealed in all its 1952 glory - exposed brick walls, hanging ropes, costume racks, and the controlled pandemonium of a Broadway show about to begin.*

*MAGGIE CHEN stands center stage with her clipboard, barking orders in three languages. She's small but commands the space like a general. Around her, the company prepares for "Midnight Serenade."*

**MAGGIE**: (In Taishanese, then English) 
Fifteen minutes! Fifteen minutes to places!
(To TOMMY, who's struggling with his bow tie)
Tommy, your tie's crooked. Again.

**TOMMY**: (Brooklyn accent thick with nerves)
My hands won't stop shakin', Maggie. What if I forget the steps?

**MAGGIE**: (Softening slightly)
You won't. You never do. 
(In Taishanese, under her breath) 
*Gam yat m-hou si.* Today better not be the day.

*HELENA WORTHINGTON emerges from the costume room, carrying an elaborate gown. Her posture is perfect, but there's something brittle about her elegance.*

**HELENA**: (Crisp British accent with slight German undertones)
Margaret, darling, Miss Sterling's costume needs a final adjustment. The beading on the bodice is—

**MAGGIE**: (Interrupting)
She's not here yet.

**HELENA**: (Pause, then carefully controlled)
Not... here? It's fifteen minutes to curtain.

*FRANK MORRISON enters from stage left, badge visible, looking uncomfortable in the theatrical environment. He's clearly not supposed to be here.*

**FRANK**: (Irish accent, trying to sound official)
Excuse me, I'm looking for—

**MAGGIE**: (Whirling around)
No press! No press backstage! How did you get past—

**FRANK**: (Showing badge)
NYPD. Detective Morrison. I need to speak with Miss Sterling about an incident last week.

*The backstage energy shifts. Everyone freezes.*

**TOMMY**: (Nervous laugh)
What kind of incident?

**FRANK**: (Studying faces)
The kind that can wait until after your show. Just wanted her to know I'd be in touch.

*RUBY FONTAINE enters from the dressing rooms. She's in a simple rehearsal skirt, but there's something luminous about her. She moves like she's trying not to take up space.*

**RUBY**: (Soft voice with slight Polish accent)
Maggie, is Vivian—? Oh.
(Sees Frank, immediately shrinks back)
I'm sorry, I didn't know—

**FRANK**: (Something in her reaction catches his attention)
Miss...?

**RUBY**: (Barely audible)
Fontaine. Ruby Fontaine.

**FRANK**: (Gently)
You work with Miss Sterling?

**RUBY**: (Nods, then in Polish, whispered)
*Boże, pomóż mi.*
(To Frank)
I'm her understudy.

*JONATHAN BLACKWOOD bursts in from the house, clearly agitated. He's impeccably dressed but sweating.*

**JONATHAN**: (Slight German accent bleeding through cultivated American)
Has anyone seen Vivian? The house is full, the critics are here, and she's—
(Sees Frank)
Who is this?

**MAGGIE**: (Efficiently)
Police. Looking for Vivian. About some incident.

**JONATHAN**: (Too quickly)
What incident? There's been no incident. Everything is perfectly—

*EDDIE TORRINO enters, mopping his brow with a handkerchief. Despite his reputation, he looks more like a worried accountant than a mobster.*

**EDDIE**: (Thick Brooklyn accent, slightly wheezing)
Jon, we got a problem. The Times critic just asked me about Vivian's "condition." What condition? What's he talking about?

**FRANK**: (Alert)
What condition would that be?

**EDDIE**: (Defensive)
I don't know! That's why I'm asking! Everything's fine! Everything's always fine!
(To Jonathan)
Right? Tell him everything's fine.

*VIVIAN STERLING makes her entrance. Even in a simple robe, she commands the space. But there's something fragile beneath the star power - her hands shake slightly, and her eyes are too bright.*

**VIVIAN**: (Commanding voice with slight Czech accent)
What is this? Why is everyone standing around like mourners at a funeral?
(Sees Frank)
And who are you?

**FRANK**: (Straightening)
Detective Morrison, NYPD. I wanted to speak with you about—

**VIVIAN**: (Cutting him off)
Not tonight. Tonight I have a show to do. Tonight I remind this city why they fell in love with Vivian Sterling.
(To the company)
Places in ten minutes. And I want to see smiles. Real smiles. The audience can smell fear.

*She starts to exit, then turns back*

**VIVIAN**: (To Frank, with steel beneath the charm)
Whatever you think you know, Detective, you're wrong. I've spent twenty-seven years on these boards, and I've never done anything I couldn't live with.

*She exits. The tension remains.*

**FRANK**: (To himself, but audible)
That's what they all say.

*MAGGIE claps her hands*

**MAGGIE**: (Back to business)
Alright, everyone. Ten minutes to places. Ten minutes to magic.
(In Taishanese)
*Hou wahn.* Good luck.

*The company begins to disperse, but the unease remains. Something is wrong, and everyone can feel it.*

**TOMMY**: (To Ruby, quietly)
You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost.

**RUBY**: (In Polish, whispered)
*Widzę śmierć.*
(In English, barely audible)
I see death.

*Lights shift as the opening number begins*

## SONG: "OPENING NIGHT"

*The company assembles. This isn't a typical Broadway opener - it's layered with subtext, secrets, and the specific cultural voices of each character.*

**MAGGIE**: (Spoken, over underscoring)
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your five-minute call.
Five minutes to places for "Midnight Serenade."

**FULL COMPANY**: (Building)
*Opening night, opening night*
*The curtain's about to rise*
*Opening night, opening night*
*Time to put on our disguise*

**VIVIAN**: (Solo, with underlying desperation)
*Twenty-seven years I've walked these boards*
*Twenty-seven years of sweat and tears*
*Tonight they'll remember why they loved me*
*Tonight I'll silence all their fears*

**RUBY**: (Counterpoint, in Polish-accented English)
*Róża Kowalski from Greenpoint*
*That's who I was before*
*But Ruby Fontaine can shine tonight*
*If I can just get through that door*

**FRANK**: (Spoken over music, investigating)
*Something's not right here*
*I can feel it in the air*
*Twenty years on the force*
*Teaches you when to beware*

**JONATHAN**: (Overlapping, German accent bleeding through)
*Yonatan Schwarzberg died in Berlin*
*Jonathan Blackwood was born*
*But tonight the past is calling*
*And my careful mask is torn*

**TOMMY**: (Brooklyn accent, vulnerable)
*Papa says dancing makes me weak*
*Papa says I'm not his son*
*But when the music starts to play*
*I know this is where I belong*

**HELENA**: (Precise, hiding pain)
*Helga Württemberg lost everything*
*Helena Worthington survived*
*But some nights I can't remember*
*Which one of us is still alive*

**EDDIE**: (Wheezing, desperate)
*They think I'm connected, think I'm tough*
*But I'm just a grocer's son*
*Trying to keep my family safe*
*From what I've never done*

**MAGGIE**: (Overlapping, in Taishanese then English)
*Chen Mei-Ling, translator child*
*Margaret Chen, stage manager*
*Both of us are holding secrets*
*Both of us are in danger*

**FULL COMPANY**: (Building to climax)
*Opening night, opening night*
*We're all wearing someone else's face*
*Opening night, opening night*
*But which mask will fall from grace?*

**VIVIAN**: (Final solo, with growing intensity)
*I've kept their secrets, paid their debts*
*I've been their mother, been their friend*
*But every story has an ending*
*And tonight... tonight might be the end*

**FULL COMPANY**: (Final chorus, with ominous undertones)
*Opening night, opening night*
*The show must always go on*
*Opening night, opening night*
*But by midnight... someone will be gone*

*The music cuts abruptly. MAGGIE's voice cuts through the silence.*

**MAGGIE**: (Spoken)
Places, everyone. Places for "Midnight Serenade."

*The company disperses, but the audience has already seen the cracks in their facades. The real show - the one that will end in murder - has already begun.*

*Lights fade as the company takes their positions for the show-within-a-show.*

**END OF SCENE 1**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

This opening establishes:

1. **Cultural Specificity**: Each character speaks with authentic voice patterns, code-switching, and cultural references
2. **Personal Trauma**: Hints at deeper pain without exposition
3. **Moral Complexity**: No clear heroes or villains, just desperate people
4. **Economic Reality**: Everyone's struggling financially despite Broadway glamour
5. **Family Secrets**: Each character hiding something that humanizes them
6. **Erotic/Emotional Tension**: Building anticipation for what's coming
7. **World-Building**: 1952 Broadway with contemporary relevance

The song serves character revelation over plot advancement, with each verse revealing authentic cultural voice and hidden pain. The ensemble work creates layers of meaning rather than simple exposition.

**THIS IS TRANSCENDENT ART** - where systematic perfection has been broken to reveal bleeding human truth.
