## **OPENING**

*(Lights up on a pristine suburban kitchen. Everything is expensive and perfectly coordinated - granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, fresh flowers that look artificial. CLAIRE stands at the coffee maker, moving through her routine with mechanical precision. MICHAEL sits at the kitchen island, laptop open, phone in hand, completely absorbed in his screens.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself, starting the coffee routine)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight...

*(She glances at MICHAEL, who doesn't look up)*

Michael, do you want eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up)*
Mm-hmm.

**CLAIRE**: *(sharper)*
Michael. Eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(still typing)*
Whatever, babe. I'm in the middle of something.

*(CLAIRE stares at him for a moment, then begins the song)*

## **SONG: "PICKET FENCE PRISON" (WITH MEMORY REVEALS)**

**CLAIRE**: *(starting quietly, moving through her routine)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight  
Volunteer meeting, can't be late  
Check the Ring camera, wave at the street  
Perfect performance, rinse and repeat  

*(She looks at MICHAEL, who hasn't moved)*

Twenty-five years of the same routine  
Playing the part of suburban queen  
But when did I stop and when did I start  
Just going through motions without any heart?  

*(Memory space lights up upstage - CLAIRE's MOTHER on her deathbed)*

**MOTHER**: *(weak, dying)*
I was so tired, Claire. So tired of being perfect.  
I never got to be... just me.

**CLAIRE**: *(present, voice breaking)*
I used to dream of something more  
Than matching towels and marble floors  
I used to burn, I used to feel  
Now nothing here seems even real  

*(Another memory space - the miscarriages)*

**YOUNGER CLAIRE**: *(in memory, to Michael)*
We can try again. We can keep trying.

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory)*
What if we lose another one? What if I can't protect them?

**YOUNGER CLAIRE**: *(in memory)*
Then I'll be strong enough for both of us.

*(Back to present - CLAIRE's voice becoming desperate)*

**CLAIRE**:
These picket fences feel like bars  
And this dream house is my prison yard  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

*(MICHAEL finally looks up, and we see his memory)*

**MICHAEL**: *(in memory space, to a therapist)*
Every time I try to comfort her, I say the wrong thing.  
Every time I reach for her, she's already being strong for someone else.  
It's easier to love her from a distance where I can't disappoint her.

**CLAIRE**: *(building to climax)*
Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But I'm dying inside this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Are the walls of my suburban prison  

*(The doorbell rings. MICHAEL doesn't move - we see his internal paralysis)*

**MICHAEL**: *(internal voice)*
If I get up, if I try to help, what if I do it wrong again?

**CLAIRE**: *(sarcastically, but with deep pain)*
I'll get it. Like I get everything else.

## **THE DAVID ENTRANCE**

*(CLAIRE opens the door to DAVID STERLING - tall, controlled presence, holding a package. His memory space lights up too)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? Package for your husband.

*(DAVID's memory space shows SARAH collapsing during their scene)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
I trust you completely.

**DAVID**: *(in memory, desperate)*
Sarah! Sarah, stay with me!

*(Back to present - DAVID studies CLAIRE's face)*

**DAVID**: *(recognizing something)*
Are you alright?

**CLAIRE**: *(surprised by the question)*
I... what?

**DAVID**: *(seeing her mother's invisible death in her)*
You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time.

*(CLAIRE's memory of her mother's funeral)*

**AUNT MARGARET**: *(in memory)*
Your mother cried herself to sleep every night, Claire.  
She felt invisible in her own life.

**CLAIRE**: *(present, barely audible)*
I am.

**DAVID**: *(his own trauma making him gentle)*
You should try breathing.

*(DAVID's memory - Sarah's last words)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me you'll find someone else to take care of.  
Don't let my death make you stop caring.

*(MICHAEL calls from kitchen)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? Who is it?

*(All memory spaces light up simultaneously)*

**MOTHER**: *(in memory)*
A lady never shows her needs.

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory)*
What if I fail her again?

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Don't stop caring.

*(Back to present - the spell breaks)*

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Just... just a delivery. Thank you.

**DAVID**: *(handing her his card)*
David Sterling. I'm new to the neighborhood. If you ever need anything...

*(He looks directly into her eyes)*

Anything at all.

**CLAIRE**: *(taking the card, hand trembling)*
Claire. Claire Morrison.

**DAVID**: *(with deeper meaning)*
I know.

*(He turns to leave, then pauses)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? That breath you've been holding?  
It's safe to let it out now.

*(He leaves. CLAIRE stands in the doorway, all memory spaces still lit)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to the memories)*
Mother... Michael... what if there's another way to live?

*(MICHAEL from kitchen)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? What's taking so long?

*(CLAIRE looks at David's card, then at the kitchen)*

**CLAIRE**: *(finishing the song, to all the memories)*
The coffee tastes different this morning  
Like possibility, like change  
Like the first day  
Of breaking free from this cage  

*(She looks at the card)*

There's got to be something more...  
And maybe... maybe I just found the door.

*(All memory spaces fade except one - her MOTHER)*

**MOTHER**: *(gently)*
Breathe, Claire. Just breathe.

*(CLAIRE takes her first real breath in years)*

## **ROSA'S ENTRANCE**

*(As CLAIRE stares at the card, ROSA SANTOS enters with cleaning supplies, using her key)*

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
Señora Claire, you want me to clean the guest room today?

**CLAIRE**: *(startled, quickly hiding the card)*
Oh! Rosa, I didn't hear you come in.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
I use the key you gave me. Like every Tuesday for five years.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Of course. Yes, the guest room is fine.

*(ROSA starts cleaning, watching CLAIRE fidget with the card)*

**ROSA**: *(without looking up)*
New friend?

**CLAIRE**: 
What? Oh, no. Just... a delivery man.

**ROSA**: *(still cleaning)*
Delivery men don't usually give business cards.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
It's nothing, Rosa. Just... neighborly.

**ROSA**: *(finally looking at her)*
Señora Claire, in my country, we have a saying: "El que busca, encuentra." He who seeks, finds.

**CLAIRE**: 
What's that supposed to mean?

**ROSA**: *(shrugging, back to cleaning)*
You've been seeking something for a long time. Just be careful what you find.

**CLAIRE**: *(irritated)*
I'm not seeking anything. I'm perfectly happy.

**ROSA**: *(pausing her cleaning)*
Sí, I can see that. Very happy. That's why you sing sad songs to your coffee maker every morning.

**CLAIRE**: 
You... you heard that?

**ROSA**: 
Señora, I clean your house. I hear everything. Your husband on his video games at 2 AM, you crying in the shower, the silence at dinner. Very happy family.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
Every marriage has its challenges...

**ROSA**: *(resuming cleaning)*
Sí, challenges. Like my neighbor Maria - her husband drinks, beats her, lost his job. Those are challenges. Your husband ignores you while making six figures? That's... how you say... first world problems.

**CLAIRE**: 
That's not fair, Rosa. Just because my problems aren't life-threatening doesn't mean they're not real.

**ROSA**: *(considering this)*
You're right. Drowning in three feet of water is still drowning. But maybe... learn to swim instead of looking for a lifeguard?

*(MICHAEL enters, finally looking up from his laptop)*

**MICHAEL**: 
Claire? Who was at the door?

**CLAIRE**: *(looking between the card and Rosa)*
Just... a neighbor. New to the area.

**MICHAEL**: *(already back to his screen)*
That's nice. Rosa, thanks for coming early today. I've got calls starting at eight.

**ROSA**: *(to CLAIRE, pointedly)*
Sí, Señor Michael. I'll be very quiet while you work.

*(She exits to clean another room, leaving CLAIRE with the card and MICHAEL with his screens)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself, looking at the card)*
Learn to swim...

*(She takes a deep breath - the first real one we've seen)*

Or find a lifeguard.

*(Lights fade as she stares at David's card)*

## **SCENE ANALYSIS**

### **What This Scene Accomplishes**
1. **Establishes Claire's desperation** - 25 years of performance and emptiness
2. **Shows Michael's emotional absence** - physically present, emotionally gone
3. **Introduces David's power** - he sees Claire immediately and authentically
4. **Reveals backstory through memory** - mother's invisible death, miscarriage trauma
5. **Introduces Rosa's perspective** - reality check on privilege and choice
6. **Creates the spark** - Claire's first taste of being truly seen
7. **Sets up the central conflict** - safety vs. authenticity, performance vs. truth

### **Key Acting Notes**
- **Claire**: Must show 25 years of suppressed frustration breaking through
- **Michael**: Pathetic but not cartoonish - genuinely absorbed in avoiding pain
- **David**: Controlled, observant, immediately sees what Claire needs
- **Rosa**: Dry, observant, provides reality without judgment
- **Memory Figures**: Must feel like real memories, not exposition

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Memory Spaces**: Multiple areas that can light independently
- **Simultaneous Action**: Past and present happening at once
- **Seamless Transitions**: Between memory and present reality
- **Intimate Staging**: Close quarters that feel like real kitchen
- **Lighting Design**: Complex system for memory reveals

### **The Hook**
David's line "You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time" should hit the audience like a revelation - someone finally sees Claire as she actually is. Rosa's follow-up about learning to swim vs. finding a lifeguard sets up Claire's central choice.

**This scene establishes that Claire isn't seeking BDSM or an affair - she's seeking someone who sees her as worth commanding, worth noticing, worth breathing for. The affair begins not with seduction, but with recognition.**
