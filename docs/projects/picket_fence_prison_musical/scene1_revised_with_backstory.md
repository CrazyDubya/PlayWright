---

## **OPENING - THE ROUTINE**

*(Lights up on Claire's kitchen. CLAIRE moves through her morning routine, but her movements are slightly off - like she's dancing to music only she can hear. MICHAEL sits at the island, absorbed in his laptop.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(starting the coffee, but her voice has an edge)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight...

*(She pauses, staring at the coffee maker. A memory space lights up upstage - we see a YOUNGER CLAIRE and her MOTHER)*

**MOTHER**: *(in memory space, perfect posture)*
A lady never shows her needs, Claire. A lady makes everyone else comfortable first.

**CLAIRE**: *(back to present, continuing routine)*
Volunteer meeting, can't be late...

*(She looks at MICHAEL, who doesn't look up. Another memory space lights up - CLAIRE and MICHAEL in a hospital room)*

**DOCTOR**: *(in memory)*
I'm sorry. There's no heartbeat.

**MICHAEL**: *(in memory, breaking down)*
Not again. Please, not again.

**CLAIRE**: *(in memory, immediately comforting him)*
It's okay, honey. We'll be okay. We have the twins.

*(Back to present - CLAIRE stares at MICHAEL, who's still on his laptop)*

**CLAIRE**: *(sharper)*
Michael, do you want eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up, but we hear his internal voice)*
If I look up, if I engage, if I try... what if I fail her again?

**CLAIRE**: *(louder)*
Michael. Eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(still typing)*
Whatever, babe. I'm in the middle of something.

## **SONG: "PICKET FENCE PRISON" (REVISED WITH BACKSTORY)**

**CLAIRE**: *(starting quietly, but building)*
Twenty-five years of the same routine  
Playing the part of suburban queen  
But when did I stop and when did I start  
Just going through motions without any heart?  

*(Memory space lights up - CLAIRE's MOTHER on her deathbed)*

**MOTHER**: *(weak, dying)*
I was so tired, Claire. So tired of being perfect.  
I never got to be... just me.

**CLAIRE**: *(present, voice breaking)*
I used to dream of something more  
Than matching towels and marble floors  
I used to burn, I used to feel  
Now nothing here seems even real  

*(Another memory - the miscarriages)*

**YOUNGER CLAIRE**: *(in memory, to Michael)*
We can try again. We can keep trying.

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory)*
What if we lose another one? What if I can't protect them?

**YOUNGER CLAIRE**: *(in memory)*
Then I'll be strong enough for both of us.

*(Back to present - CLAIRE's voice becoming desperate)*

**CLAIRE**:
These picket fences feel like bars  
And this dream house is my prison yard  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

*(MICHAEL finally looks up, and we see his memory)*

**MICHAEL**: *(in memory space, to a therapist)*
Every time I try to comfort her, I say the wrong thing.  
Every time I reach for her, she's already being strong for someone else.  
It's easier to love her from a distance where I can't disappoint her.

**CLAIRE**: *(building to climax)*
Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But I'm dying inside this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Are the walls of my suburban prison  

*(The doorbell rings. MICHAEL doesn't move - we see his internal paralysis)*

**MICHAEL**: *(internal voice)*
If I get up, if I try to help, what if I do it wrong again?

**CLAIRE**: *(sarcastically, but with deep pain)*
I'll get it. Like I get everything else.

## **THE DAVID ENTRANCE (REVISED)**

*(CLAIRE opens the door to DAVID. But now we see his memory space light up too)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? Package for your husband.

*(DAVID's memory space shows SARAH collapsing during their scene)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
I trust you completely.

**DAVID**: *(in memory, desperate)*
Sarah! Sarah, stay with me!

*(Back to present - DAVID studies CLAIRE's face)*

**DAVID**: *(recognizing something)*
Are you alright?

**CLAIRE**: *(surprised by the question)*
I... what?

**DAVID**: *(seeing her mother's invisible death in her)*
You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time.

*(CLAIRE's memory of her mother's funeral)*

**AUNT MARGARET**: *(in memory)*
Your mother cried herself to sleep every night, Claire.  
She felt invisible in her own life.

**CLAIRE**: *(present, barely audible)*
I am.

**DAVID**: *(his own trauma making him gentle)*
You should try breathing.

*(DAVID's memory - Sarah's last words)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me you'll find someone else to take care of.  
Don't let my death make you stop caring.

*(MICHAEL calls from kitchen)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? Who is it?

*(All three memory spaces light up simultaneously)*

**MOTHER**: *(in memory)*
A lady never shows her needs.

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory)*
What if I fail her again?

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Don't stop caring.

*(Back to present - the spell breaks)*

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Just... just a delivery. Thank you.

**DAVID**: *(handing her his card)*
David Sterling. I'm new to the neighborhood. If you ever need anything...

*(He looks directly into her eyes)*

Anything at all.

**CLAIRE**: *(taking the card, hand trembling)*
Claire. Claire Morrison.

**DAVID**: *(with deeper meaning)*
I know.

*(He turns to leave, then pauses)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? That breath you've been holding?  
It's safe to let it out now.

*(He leaves. CLAIRE stands in the doorway, all the memory spaces still lit)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to the memories)*
Mother... Michael... what if there's another way to live?

*(MICHAEL from kitchen)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? What's taking so long?

*(CLAIRE looks at David's card, then at the kitchen)*

**CLAIRE**: *(finishing the song, to all the memories)*
The coffee tastes different this morning  
Like possibility, like change  
Like the first day  
Of breaking free from this cage  

*(She looks at the card)*

There's got to be something more...  
And maybe... maybe I just found the door.

*(All memory spaces fade except one - her MOTHER)*

**MOTHER**: *(gently)*
Breathe, Claire. Just breathe.

*(CLAIRE takes her first real breath in years as lights fade)*

## **WHAT THIS REVISION ACCOMPLISHES**

### **Shows, Don't Tells:**
- **Claire's mother's invisible death** - explains her fear of authenticity
- **Michael's miscarriage trauma** - explains his emotional withdrawal  
- **David's loss of Sarah** - explains his careful approach to Claire
- **The cycle of protection** - everyone protecting everyone else from pain

### **Makes Them Sympathetic:**
- **Claire** isn't entitled - she's repeating her mother's tragedy
- **Michael** isn't absent - he's protecting Claire from his own inadequacy
- **David** isn't predatory - he's honoring his dead wife's wish to keep caring

### **Broadway Staging:**
- **Multiple memory spaces** allow simultaneous past/present action
- **Choreographed memories** that dance with present action
- **Layered vocals** where past and present voices blend
- **Visual storytelling** through lighting and staging

### **The Cultural Critique:**
- **Perfectionism kills** (Claire's mother)
- **Toxic masculinity prevents healing** (Michael's withdrawal)
- **Trauma without therapy creates broken coping** (all of them)
- **Everyone's trying to protect everyone else** and creating more pain

**This version makes the audience understand before they judge. We see the trauma that created these broken people, and suddenly their choices make sense - even if they're still wrong.**

**Ready to tackle Scene 2 with Jessica's adoption trauma reveal, or should we refine this backstory integration further?**
