## **SCENE 1 SCRIPT**

### **Opening**
*(Lights up on a pristine suburban kitchen. Everything is expensive and perfectly coordinated - granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, fresh flowers that look artificial. CLAIRE stands at the coffee maker, moving through her routine with mechanical precision. MICHAEL sits at the kitchen island, laptop open, phone in hand, completely absorbed in his screens.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself, starting the coffee routine)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight...

*(She glances at MICHAEL, who doesn't look up)*

Michael, do you want eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up)*
Mm-hmm.

**CLAIRE**: *(sharper)*
Michael. Eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(still typing)*
Whatever, babe. I'm in the middle of something.

*(CLAIRE stares at him for a moment, then begins the song)*

### **SONG: "PICKET FENCE PRISON"**

**CLAIRE**: *(starting quietly, moving through her routine)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight  
Volunteer meeting, can't be late  
Check the Ring camera, wave at the street  
Perfect performance, rinse and repeat  

*(She looks at MICHAEL, who hasn't moved)*

Twenty-five years of the same routine  
Playing the part of suburban queen  
But when did I stop and when did I start  
Just going through motions without any heart?  

*(Building intensity)*
I used to dream of something more  
Than matching towels and marble floors  
I used to burn, I used to feel  
Now nothing here seems even real  

*(Full voice)*
These picket fences feel like bars  
And this dream house is my prison yard  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But I'm dying inside this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Are the walls of my suburban prison  

*(MICHAEL finally looks up)*

**MICHAEL**: 
You say something, babe?

**CLAIRE**: *(staring at him)*
Twenty-five years, Michael. Twenty-five years I've been talking, and you just now noticed I have a voice.

**MICHAEL**: *(defensive)*
I'm working, Claire. This deal closes today. You know how important—

**CLAIRE**: *(cutting him off)*
Everything's important except what's happening in this kitchen. In this house. In this marriage.

**MICHAEL**: *(back to his screen)*
We'll talk later, okay? I promise.

*(CLAIRE continues the song, her voice becoming more desperate)*

**CLAIRE**:
Michael's lunch packed, his coffee poured  
He'll grunt "thanks babe" and head out the door  
Twenty years married, we barely speak  
Just two strangers sharing the same technique  

*(Looking at family photos)*
The girls are at college, living their dreams  
While I'm still here, bursting at the seams  
They think I'm happy, they think I'm fine  
But I'm disappearing one day at a time  

*(Building to climax)*
There's got to be more than this  
There's got to be something I've missed  
Some part of me that's still alive  
Some reason to more than just survive  

*(The doorbell rings. MICHAEL doesn't move.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(sarcastically)*
I'll get it.

*(She moves to the door, still in her emotional state from the song. Opens it to reveal DAVID STERLING - tall, controlled presence, holding a package.)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? Package for your husband.

*(CLAIRE looks at him - really looks. There's an immediate, unexpected charge in the air.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(caught off guard)*
I... yes. Thank you.

*(She reaches for the package. Their hands touch briefly. The moment hangs.)*

**DAVID**: *(studying her face)*
Are you alright?

**CLAIRE**: *(surprised by the question)*
I... what?

**DAVID**: 
You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time.

*(CLAIRE stares at him, shocked that someone has actually seen her.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(barely audible)*
I am.

**DAVID**: *(gentle but direct)*
You should try breathing.

*(Another moment. MICHAEL calls from the kitchen.)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? Who is it?

*(The spell breaks. CLAIRE steps back.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Just... just a delivery. Thank you.

**DAVID**: *(handing her a business card)*
David Sterling. I'm new to the neighborhood. If you ever need anything...

*(He looks directly into her eyes)*

Anything at all.

*(CLAIRE takes the card, her hand trembling slightly.)*

**CLAIRE**: 
Claire. Claire Morrison.

**DAVID**: 
I know.

*(He turns to leave, then pauses.)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? That breath you've been holding? It's safe to let it out now.

*(He leaves. CLAIRE stands in the doorway, holding the card, breathing heavily.)*

**MICHAEL**: *(from kitchen)*
Claire? What's taking so long?

*(CLAIRE looks at the card, then at the kitchen where MICHAEL sits absorbed in his screens.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
Nothing, Michael. Nothing at all.

*(She closes the door, leans against it.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(finishing the song, quietly)*
The coffee tastes different this morning  
Like possibility, like change  
Like the first day  
Of something strange  

*(She looks at David's card)*

There's got to be something more...  
And maybe... maybe I just found the door.

*(Lights fade as she stares at the card)*

## **Scene Analysis**

### **What This Scene Accomplishes**
1. **Establishes Claire's desperation** - 25 years of emptiness
2. **Shows Michael's pathetic absence** - physically present, emotionally gone
3. **Introduces David's power** - he sees Claire immediately
4. **Creates the spark** - Claire's unexpected response to being seen
5. **Sets up the world** - wealthy suburban isolation

### **Key Acting Notes**
- **Claire**: Must show 25 years of suppressed frustration breaking through
- **Michael**: Pathetic but not cartoonish - genuinely absorbed in his digital world
- **David**: Controlled, observant, immediately sees what Claire needs

### **The Hook**
David's line "You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time" should hit the audience like a revelation - someone finally sees Claire as she actually is.

**This scene establishes that Claire is starving for authentic connection, and David provides it immediately. The affair begins not with seduction, but with recognition.**
