## **ROSA'S INTRODUCTION - Scene 1 Addition**

*(After David leaves and Claire is staring at his card, ROSA enters with cleaning supplies)*

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
Señora Claire, you want me to clean the guest room today?

**CLAIRE**: *(startled, hiding the card)*
Oh! Rosa, I didn't hear you come in.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
I use the key you gave me. Like every Tuesday for five years.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Of course. Yes, the guest room is fine.

*(ROSA starts cleaning, watching Claire fidget with the card)*

**ROSA**: *(without looking up)*
New friend?

**CLAIRE**: 
What? Oh, no. Just... a delivery man.

**ROSA**: *(still cleaning)*
Delivery men don't usually give business cards.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
It's nothing, Rosa. Just... neighborly.

**ROSA**: *(finally looking at her)*
Señora Claire, in my country, we have a saying: "El que busca, encuentra." He who seeks, finds.

**CLAIRE**: 
What's that supposed to mean?

**ROSA**: *(shrugging)*
You've been seeking something for a long time. Just be careful what you find.

*(She goes back to cleaning as CLAIRE stares at her)*

## **ROSA'S SONGS THROUGHOUT THE MUSICAL**

### **"Invisible Woman" (Act I, Scene 3)**
**Purpose**: Rosa observes the block party drama while serving drinks
**Key Lyrics**: 
```
I'm the invisible woman in your perfect world
Serving your drinks while your drama unfurls
You think I don't see, you think I don't know
But I clean up the messes wherever I go

I've seen real problems, I've seen real pain
Not this suburban, privileged refrain
You want to feel special, you want to feel seen
While I'm just the help in your perfect scene
```

### **"What Real Problems Look Like" (Act II, Scene 2)**
**Purpose**: Rosa's reality check when Claire complains about her "difficult" life
**Key Lyrics**:
```
You want to know problems? Let me tell you about problems
My sister's got cancer, no insurance to pay
My nephew's in jail, can't afford a lawyer
My mother needs medicine every single day

I work three jobs just to send money home
While you cry about feeling alone
In your million-dollar house with your perfect lawn
Complaining your husband's emotionally gone

These aren't problems, these are choices
Rich white lady voices
Whining about your golden cage
While I'm working for minimum wage
```

### **"The Reckoning" (Act II, Finale)**
**Purpose**: Rosa's final judgment that destroys their self-pity narratives
**Key Lyrics**:
```
You want to know the truth? I'll give you the truth
You're all just spoiled children playing with fire
You had everything - love, money, family, youth
And you threw it away for your selfish desire

Claire, you had a husband who worked to provide
While you sat home and pouted and cried
Jessica, you sold your body for attention and cash
While calling it empowerment - what a load of trash

David, you're a predator with a sad story
Using your grief to justify your glory
Michael, you checked out when life got hard
Left your wife alone in your own backyard

And the neighbors? You're all just as bad
Watching the show while pretending you're mad
Paying for content while judging the source
Hypocrites all, without any remorse

I've cleaned your houses, I've seen your lies
I've watched you perform while your marriages die
You want validation for your selfish choices?
Well, here's the truth from one of the invisible voices:

You're not victims, you're not heroes
You're just people with first-world problems and egos
You had everything and you chose to destroy it
For drama, for pleasure, for whatever you call it

So don't come crying when it all falls apart
You broke your own lives, you broke your own hearts
I'll clean up the mess like I always do
But I won't pretend to feel sorry for you
```

## **ROSA'S FINAL SCENE - THE SLAYING**

*(Six months later. Rosa is cleaning Claire's house, which is now half-empty. Claire sits at the kitchen table, looking defeated)*

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa, I... I wanted to thank you. For everything. I know this has been... difficult.

**ROSA**: *(not stopping her work)*
Difficult for who, Señora?

**CLAIRE**: 
For all of us. This whole situation...

**ROSA**: *(finally stopping, turning to face her)*
Let me ask you something, Señora Claire. Do you know what I did before I came here today?

**CLAIRE**: 
I... no.

**ROSA**: 
I took my neighbor's daughter to the emergency room. She's eight years old, she has pneumonia, and her mother can't afford to miss work. So I sat with this little girl for six hours while she struggled to breathe, because that's what you do when someone actually needs help.

*(She resumes cleaning)*

Then I came here to clean your house while you sit and feel sorry for yourself because your affair didn't work out the way you wanted.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
Rosa, you don't understand...

**ROSA**: *(cutting her off)*
I understand perfectly. You had a good life and you threw it away because you were bored. You had a husband who loved you and you betrayed him because a stranger paid you attention. You had everything and you chose nothing.

**CLAIRE**: 
But my mother...

**ROSA**: 
Your mother is dead, Señora. She can't live your life for you, and she can't excuse your choices. You want to honor her memory? Stop making the same mistakes she made.

**CLAIRE**: *(breaking down)*
I just... I felt so invisible...

**ROSA**: *(harsh)*
You want to know about invisible? I've been cleaning your house for five years. Do you know my last name? Do you know if I have children? Do you know anything about my life beyond what I do for you?

*(CLAIRE stares, realizing she doesn't)*

That's invisible, Señora. You were just ignored. There's a difference.

*(She finishes cleaning, packs her supplies)*

I won't be coming back next week. Mrs. Patterson offered me full-time work, and I need the money more than I need to watch you feel sorry for yourself.

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa, please...

**ROSA**: *(at the door)*
You want some advice? Stop looking for someone to save you. Stop looking for someone to blame. Stop looking for someone to validate your choices. Just... stop looking for someone else to be responsible for your life.

*(She pauses)*

And maybe, just maybe, try looking at the people who were actually there for you before you threw them away.

*(She leaves. CLAIRE sits alone in her half-empty house as the lights fade)*
