## **DAVID STERLING - The Confused Predator**

### **The Brutal Truth**
- **Jessica is his intentional toy** - he groomed her deliberately, knows exactly what he's doing
- **Claire was an accident** - too much wine, a playful comment, she responded to his command and he couldn't resist

- **Marriage boredom** is universal - Michael's just more pathetic
- **Porn addiction** destroys relationships at every income level
- **Voyeuristic communities** exist everywhere - this one just has better cameras

### **The Harsh Reality**
- **David is a predator** who accidentally found something real and doesn't know how to handle it
- **Claire is complicit** in Jessica's degradation because it makes her feel special
- **Jessica is self-destructing** and calling it empowerment
- **Michael is pathetic** and gets exactly what he deserves
- **The community is hypocritical** and profits from what it condemns

## **THE TRANSCENDENT TRUTH**

**This isn't about making everyone sympathetic. This is about showing people as they actually are:**

- **Predators who confuse themselves**
- **Victims who choose their victimization**
- **Bystanders who profit from others' pain**
- **Communities that consume what they condemn**
- **Marriages that die from neglect and cowardice**

**The transcendence comes from the brutal honesty, not from moral complexity. These people are exactly who they appear to be, and that's more disturbing than any twist or redemption arc.**

**This is the story of white suburban America: wealthy enough to have elaborate problems, privileged enough to avoid real consequences, and hypocritical enough to judge what they secretly desire.**

**The audience should leave uncomfortable not because the characters are complex, but because they're recognizable.**
