## **OPENING**

*(Lights up on Claire's kitchen. Everything is expensive and perfectly coordinated - granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, fresh flowers that look artificial. CLAIRE stands at the coffee maker, moving through her routine with mechanical precision. MICHAEL sits at the kitchen island, laptop open, phone in hand, completely absorbed in his screens.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself, starting the coffee routine)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight...

*(She glances at MICHAEL, who doesn't look up)*

Michael, do you want eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up)*
Mm-hmm.

**CLAIRE**: *(sharper)*
Michael. Eggs?

**MICHAEL**: *(still typing)*
Whatever, babe. I'm in the middle of something.

*(CLAIRE stares at him for a moment, then begins the song. A memory space lights up upstage - we see CLAIRE'S MOTHER, perfect posture, setting a breakfast table)*

---

## **SONG: "PICKET FENCE PRISON" (WITH MEMORY INTEGRATION)**

**CLAIRE**: *(starting quietly, moving through her routine)*
Coffee at seven, yoga at eight  
Volunteer meeting, can't be late  
Check the Ring camera, wave at the street  
Perfect performance, rinse and repeat  

*(Memory space: MOTHER speaks while setting table)*

**MOTHER**: *(in memory space)*
A lady never shows her needs, Claire  
A lady makes everyone else comfortable first  
Remember, darling, we're always being watched  

**CLAIRE**: *(back to present, voice building)*
Twenty-five years of the same routine  
Playing the part of suburban queen  
But when did I stop and when did I start  
Just going through motions without any heart?  

*(She looks at MICHAEL, who hasn't moved. Another memory space lights up - CLAIRE and MICHAEL in a hospital room)*

**DOCTOR**: *(in memory)*
I'm sorry. There's no heartbeat.

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory, breaking down)*
Not again. Please, not again. I can't... I can't do this again.

**YOUNGER CLAIRE**: *(in memory, immediately comforting him)*
It's okay, honey. We'll be okay. We have the twins. We'll be strong.

*(Back to present - CLAIRE stares at MICHAEL, who's still on his laptop)*

**CLAIRE**: *(voice breaking)*
I used to dream of something more  
Than matching towels and marble floors  
I used to burn, I used to feel  
Now nothing here seems even real  

*(MICHAEL finally looks up, and we see his memory space)*

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory space, to a therapist)*
Every time I try to comfort her, I say the wrong thing  
Every time I reach for her, she's already being strong for someone else  
It's easier to love her from a distance where I can't disappoint her  

**CLAIRE**: *(building to climax, full voice)*
These picket fences feel like bars  
And this dream house is my prison yard  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But I'm dying inside this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Are the walls of my suburban prison  

*(The doorbell rings. MICHAEL doesn't move - we see his internal paralysis)*

**MICHAEL**: *(internal voice, in memory space)*
If I get up, if I try to help, what if I do it wrong again?  
What if I fail her like I failed our babies?

**CLAIRE**: *(sarcastically, but with deep pain)*
I'll get it. Like I get everything else.

*(She moves to the door, still in her emotional state from the song)*

---

## **THE DAVID ENTRANCE**

*(CLAIRE opens the door to DAVID STERLING - tall, controlled presence, holding a package. His memory space lights up showing SARAH collapsing during their scene)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? Package for your husband.

*(DAVID's memory space shows SARAH in suspension)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
I trust you completely, David. I've never felt safer.

**DAVID**: *(in memory, desperate)*
Sarah! Sarah, stay with me! Call 911!

*(Back to present - DAVID studies CLAIRE's face, recognizing something)*

**DAVID**: *(seeing her mother's invisible death in her)*
Are you alright?

**CLAIRE**: *(surprised by the question)*
I... what?

**DAVID**: *(gently)*
You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time.

*(CLAIRE's memory of her mother's funeral)*

**AUNT MARGARET**: *(in memory)*
Your mother cried herself to sleep every night, Claire  
She felt invisible in her own life  
Don't make the same mistake, honey  

**CLAIRE**: *(present, barely audible)*
I am.

**DAVID**: *(his own trauma making him gentle)*
You should try breathing.

*(DAVID's memory - Sarah's last words)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me you'll find someone else to take care of  
Don't let my death make you stop caring  
The world needs your kind of love  

*(MICHAEL calls from kitchen)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? Who is it?

*(All memory spaces light up simultaneously)*

**MOTHER**: *(in memory)*
A lady never shows her needs

**YOUNGER MICHAEL**: *(in memory)*
What if I fail her again?

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Don't stop caring

*(Back to present - the spell breaks)*

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Just... just a delivery. Thank you.

**DAVID**: *(handing her his card)*
David Sterling. I'm new to the neighborhood. If you ever need anything...

*(He looks directly into her eyes)*

Anything at all.

**CLAIRE**: *(taking the card, hand trembling)*
Claire. Claire Morrison.

**DAVID**: *(with deeper meaning)*
I know.

*(He turns to leave, then pauses)*

**DAVID**: 
Mrs. Morrison? That breath you've been holding?  
It's safe to let it out now.

*(He leaves. CLAIRE stands in the doorway, all the memory spaces still lit)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to the memories)*
Mother... Michael... what if there's another way to live?

*(MICHAEL from kitchen)*

**MICHAEL**: *(off-stage)*
Claire? What's taking so long?

## **ROSA'S ENTRANCE**

*(CLAIRE looks at David's card, then at the kitchen. ROSA SANTOS enters with cleaning supplies, matter-of-fact)*

**ROSA**: 
Señora Claire, you want me to clean the guest room today?

**CLAIRE**: *(startled, hiding the card)*
Oh! Rosa, I didn't hear you come in.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
I use the key you gave me. Like every Tuesday for five years.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Of course. Yes, the guest room is fine.

*(ROSA starts organizing her supplies, watching Claire fidget with the card)*

**ROSA**: *(without looking up)*
New friend?

**CLAIRE**: 
What? Oh, no. Just... a delivery man.

**ROSA**: *(still organizing)*
Delivery men don't usually give business cards.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
It's nothing, Rosa. Just... neighborly.

**ROSA**: *(finally looking at her)*
Señora Claire, in my country, we have a saying: "El que busca, encuentra." He who seeks, finds.

**CLAIRE**: 
What's that supposed to mean?

**ROSA**: *(shrugging)*
You've been seeking something for a long time. Just be careful what you find.

**CLAIRE**: *(irritated)*
I'm not seeking anything. I'm perfectly happy.

**ROSA**: *(pausing her work)*
Sí, I can see that. Very happy. That's why you sing sad songs to your coffee maker every morning.

**CLAIRE**: 
You... you heard that?

**ROSA**: 
Señora, I clean your house. I hear everything. Your husband on his video games at 2 AM, you crying in the shower, the silence at dinner. Very happy family.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
Every marriage has its challenges...

**ROSA**: *(resuming her work)*
Sí, challenges. Like my neighbor Maria - her husband drinks, beats her, lost his job. Those are challenges. Your husband ignores you while making six figures? That's... how you say... first world problems.

**CLAIRE**: 
That's not fair, Rosa. Just because my problems aren't life-threatening doesn't mean they're not real.

**ROSA**: *(considering this)*
You're right. Drowning in three feet of water is still drowning. But maybe... learn to swim instead of looking for a lifeguard?

*(She heads toward the guest room)*

**CLAIRE**: *(finishing the song, to all the memories and Rosa)*
The coffee tastes different this morning  
Like possibility, like change  
Like the first day  
Of breaking free from this cage  

*(She looks at the card)*

There's got to be something more...  
And maybe... maybe I just found the door.

*(All memory spaces fade except one - her MOTHER)*

**MOTHER**: *(gently)*
Breathe, Claire. Just breathe.

**CLAIRE**: *(takes her first real breath in years)*

*(ROSA's voice from the other room)*

**ROSA**: *(off-stage)*
And Señora? Next time you breathe... make sure it's for yourself, not for some man.

*(CLAIRE looks at the card, then at the kitchen where MICHAEL still sits absorbed in his screen, then toward where Rosa went)*

**CLAIRE**: *(quietly)*
Maybe it's time to learn how.

*(Lights fade as she puts the card in her pocket)*

## **SCENE ANALYSIS**

### **What This Scene Accomplishes**
1. **Establishes Claire's desperation** - 25 years of performed perfection
2. **Shows Michael's trauma-based absence** - protecting himself and Claire from more loss
3. **Introduces David's careful approach** - his own loss makes him gentle
4. **Reveals the cycle of protection** - everyone protecting everyone else from pain
5. **Introduces Rosa's reality checks** - working-class perspective on rich people problems

### **Memory Integration Purpose**
- **Claire's mother's invisible death** - explains her fear of authenticity
- **Michael's miscarriage trauma** - explains his emotional withdrawal
- **David's loss of Sarah** - explains his careful approach to Claire
- **Shows the trauma behind the behavior** - makes characters sympathetic without excusing choices

### **Rosa's Function**
- **Provides immediate reality check** - grounds the drama in working-class perspective
- **Establishes ongoing relationship** - sets up her recurring role
- **Offers wisdom without judgment** - "learn to swim instead of looking for a lifeguard"
- **Represents audience perspective** - practical concerns about rich people problems

### **The Hook**
David's line "You look like someone who's been holding her breath for a very long time" should hit the audience like a revelation - someone finally sees Claire as she actually is. The affair begins not with seduction, but with recognition.

**This scene establishes that Claire isn't seeking BDSM or an affair - she's seeking someone who sees her as worth commanding, worth noticing, worth breathing for.**
