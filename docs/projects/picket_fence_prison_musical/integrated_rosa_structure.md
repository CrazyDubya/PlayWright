## **SCENE 1 REVISED - ROSA'S INTRODUCTION**

### **After David leaves, Claire stares at his card**

**ROSA**: *(entering with cleaning supplies, matter-of-fact)*
Señora Claire, you want me to clean the guest room today?

**CLAIRE**: *(startled, hiding the card)*
Oh! Rosa, I didn't hear you come in.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
I use the key you gave me. Like every Tuesday for five years.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
Of course. Yes, the guest room is fine.

*(ROSA starts cleaning, watching Claire fidget with the card)*

**ROSA**: *(without looking up)*
New friend?

**CLAIRE**: 
What? Oh, no. Just... a delivery man.

**ROSA**: *(still cleaning)*
Delivery men don't usually give business cards.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
It's nothing, Rosa. Just... neighborly.

**ROSA**: *(finally looking at her)*
Señora Claire, in my country, we have a saying: "El que busca, encuentra." He who seeks, finds.

**CLAIRE**: 
What's that supposed to mean?

**ROSA**: *(shrugging, back to cleaning)*
You've been seeking something for a long time. Just be careful what you find.

**CLAIRE**: *(irritated)*
I'm not seeking anything. I'm perfectly happy.

**ROSA**: *(pausing her cleaning)*
Sí, I can see that. Very happy. That's why you sing sad songs to your coffee maker every morning.

**CLAIRE**: 
You... you heard that?

**ROSA**: 
Señora, I clean your house. I hear everything. Your husband on his video games at 2 AM, you crying in the shower, the silence at dinner. Very happy family.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
Every marriage has its challenges...

**ROSA**: *(resuming cleaning)*
Sí, challenges. Like my neighbor Maria - her husband drinks, beats her, lost his job. Those are challenges. Your husband ignores you while making six figures? That's... how you say... first world problems.

**CLAIRE**: 
That's not fair, Rosa. Just because my problems aren't life-threatening doesn't mean they're not real.

**ROSA**: *(considering this)*
You're right. Drowning in three feet of water is still drowning. But maybe... learn to swim instead of looking for a lifeguard?

*(She exits to clean another room, leaving Claire with the card)*

## **ROSA'S RECURRING INTERLUDES**

### **Interlude 1: After "No Panties Tomorrow"**
**Location**: Jessica's house, Rosa cleaning

**ROSA**: *(to audience, while dusting)*
And now the other one thinks she's discovered herself through a camera. Ay, Dios mío. I've seen this movie before. It doesn't end well.

*(JESSICA enters, excited)*

**JESSICA**: Rosa! Did you see my latest post? Fifty thousand views!

**ROSA**: *(not looking up)*
Congratulations. Very impressive. What did your mother think?

**JESSICA**: *(deflating)*
I... I haven't told her about my content creation.

**ROSA**: 
Ah. So proud you can't tell your family. Very empowering.

**JESSICA**: 
You don't understand, Rosa. This is about female sexuality and—

**ROSA**: *(interrupting)*
Mija, I understand perfectly. You're selling pictures of your nalgas to strangers for money. In my day, we called that something else.

**JESSICA**: 
It's not the same thing!

**ROSA**: *(shrugging)*
If you say so. But maybe ask yourself - if you wouldn't tell your mother, your priest, or your future daughter... maybe it's not as empowering as you think.

### **Interlude 2: After "Supermarket Seduction"**
**Location**: David's house, Rosa cleaning

**ROSA**: *(to audience)*
Now the puppet master thinks he's conducting a symphony. Two women fighting over him like he's the last taco at a quinceañera.

*(DAVID enters)*

**DAVID**: Rosa, thank you for coming on short notice.

**ROSA**: *(cleaning)*
Sí, Señor David. Though I notice you need extra cleaning after your... meetings.

**DAVID**: *(uncomfortable)*
I appreciate your discretion.

**ROSA**: 
Discretion costs extra. But I'm curious - what happened to your wife's pictures?

**DAVID**: *(surprised)*
What?

**ROSA**: 
Last week, many pictures of a beautiful woman. This week, all gone. She die or you just tired of looking at her?

**DAVID**: *(defensive)*
That's... that's personal.

**ROSA**: *(nodding)*
Sí, very personal. Like how you use other women to forget the one you lost. Very healthy.

**DAVID**: 
You don't understand the situation.

**ROSA**: 
I understand perfectly. My husband died five years ago. You know what I didn't do? Start collecting other people's husbands to fill the hole.

**DAVID**: 
It's not the same thing.

**ROSA**: *(pausing her cleaning)*
No? You're right. I had to work three jobs to survive. You get to play games with people's lives for fun. Much more sophisticated.

### **Interlude 3: After "Premium Content"**
**Location**: Claire's house, Rosa cleaning while Claire paces

**CLAIRE**: Rosa, can I ask you something?

**ROSA**: *(cleaning)*
You're going to anyway.

**CLAIRE**: 
Do you think I'm a bad person?

**ROSA**: *(considering)*
Bad? No. Selfish? Sí. Confused? Definitely. But bad? No.

**CLAIRE**: 
I just... I feel like I'm finally becoming myself.

**ROSA**: 
And who is that? The woman who lies to her husband? The woman who competes with her neighbor for a man's attention? Very authentic.

**CLAIRE**: 
You don't understand what it's like to feel invisible.

**ROSA**: *(stopping, looking at her)*
Señora Claire, I clean your house every week for five years. Do you know my last name?

**CLAIRE**: *(pause)*
I... Santos?

**ROSA**: 
Lucky guess. Do you know if I have children?

**CLAIRE**: *(longer pause)*
I... no.

**ROSA**: 
Three. Do you know why I work three jobs?

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa, I—

**ROSA**: 
To send money to my mother in Mexico for her cancer treatment. But please, tell me more about feeling invisible.

**CLAIRE**: *(ashamed)*
I'm sorry. I should have asked...

**ROSA**: *(resuming cleaning)*
Should have, could have. The point is, you think invisible means ignored. I know invisible means actually not seen. There's a difference.

## **THE FINAL CONFRONTATION - TONED DOWN**

### **Rosa's "Reckoning" - Revised**
*(Less attacking, more disappointed)*

**ROSA**: 
You want to know what I think? I think you're all very lucky people who forgot how to be grateful. You have love, money, family, choices - and you threw it away for drama.

I don't hate you. I'm just... tired. Tired of cleaning up messes that didn't need to be made. Tired of watching people with everything act like they have nothing.

You want to make these choices? Fine. But don't expect me to feel sorry for you when it all falls apart.

### **Claire's "I Choose" - Revised**
*(Less attacking the audience, more defending her choices)*

**CLAIRE**: 
You're right, Rosa. I am lucky. I had choices you didn't have. But that doesn't make my feelings less real.

Yes, I chose this mess. I chose feeling over numbness. I chose risk over safety. I chose to be a woman who wants things instead of a woman who wants nothing.

Maybe that makes me selfish. Maybe that makes me wrong. But it also makes me alive.

I'm not asking you to approve. I'm not asking anyone to approve. I'm just asking for the right to choose my own life, even if I choose badly.

**ROSA**: *(after a pause)*
You know what, Señora Claire? You're right. It's your life to ruin.

*(She packs her cleaning supplies)*

I just hope it was worth it.

- Lightens the heavy dramatic content
- Makes her more likeable before the final judgment

### **Audience Comfort**
- No direct attack on the audience
- Rosa represents their perspective without hostility
- Claire's defense is about her choices, not their voyeurism
