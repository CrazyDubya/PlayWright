## LYRICS

### **Setup**
*(Neighborhood party winding down. Claire has had too much wine, David approaches)*

**DAVID**: *(approaching with two wine glasses)*
You look like you could use another drink  

**CLAIRE**: *(laughing, slightly tipsy)*
I think I've had enough to make me think  
Dangerous thoughts about dangerous things  

**DAVID**: *(closer now, voice lower)*
What kind of dangerous thoughts, Claire?  

### **Verse 1 - CLAIRE**
*(Flirtatious but nervous)*

I used to dance like no one was watching  
Before I learned that everyone was  
I used to laugh without calculating  
The social cost of everything I does  

*(She moves closer, emboldened by wine)*

But tonight the wine is talking  
And it's saying things I shouldn't say  
Like how I notice when you're walking  
And how you make me feel a certain way  

### **Verse 1 - DAVID**
*(Studying her, voice controlled but warm)*

I've been watching you for months now  
Behind your perfect suburban mask  
There's a woman who's forgotten how  
To take what she wants, to even ask  

*(He steps closer, voice dropping)*

You move through life like you're apologizing  
For taking up space, for having needs  
But I can see through your disguising  
The fire that your careful life conceals  

### **Pre-Chorus - BOTH**
*(Building tension, circling each other)*

**CLAIRE**: There's something dangerous in your eyes  
**DAVID**: There's something hungry in your soul  
**CLAIRE**: Something that terrifies  
**DAVID**: Something that could make you whole  
**BOTH**: If you're brave enough to let it  

### **Chorus - DAVID** *(Taking control)*
*(Voice becoming more commanding)*

Dance with me like no one's watching  
Even though they are  
Show me the woman you're hiding  
Behind your suburban star  

Let me see you move your body  
Like you used to move your mind  
Before you learned that being sorry  
Was the only way to shine  

### **Verse 2 - CLAIRE**
*(Getting bolder, moving more sensually)*

I haven't felt this alive in years  
This reckless, this awake  
All my careful constructed fears  
Are starting to break  

*(She dances closer, more provocatively)*

You make me want to do things  
I've never even dreamed  
You make me want to sing  
Like I'm bursting at the seams  

### **Verse 2 - DAVID**
*(Voice getting darker, more intense)*

That's just the beginning, Claire  
Of what you're going to feel  
When you stop pretending you don't care  
About what's actually real  

*(He moves behind her, hands on her waist)*

You've been performing for so long  
You forgot who you really are  
But I can teach you a different song  
If you're willing to go that far  

### **Bridge - Spoken/Sung**
*(Music drops to almost nothing, intimate conversation)*

**DAVID**: *(low, close to her ear)*
Tell me what you want, Claire  

**CLAIRE**: *(breathless)*
I... I don't know how to want things anymore  

**DAVID**: *(gentle but firm)*
Then let me teach you  
Let me show you how to feel again  

**CLAIRE**: *(whispered)*
What would that look like?  

**DAVID**: *(building, music starting to return)*
It starts with trust  
It starts with surrender  
It starts with doing something  
You'll remember  

### **The Command - DAVID**
*(Music builds, his voice becoming commanding)*

No panties tomorrow when you go to the store  
Let every step remind you of what you're living for  
Feel the fabric of your dress against your skin  
And remember this is where your real life begins  

### **Claire's Response**
*(Shocked, aroused, conflicted)*

**CLAIRE**: *(backing away)*
I can't... I'm not... that's not who I am  
I'm a mother, I'm a wife  
I can't just change the plan  
I've built my entire life  

**DAVID**: *(following, voice gentle but insistent)*
That's exactly who you are, Claire  
You just forgot how to let her breathe  
The woman who danced without a care  
Is still there underneath  

### **Final Chorus - BOTH**
*(Building to climax)*

**DAVID**: No panties tomorrow, feel alive again  
**CLAIRE**: I'm terrified of what that might begin  
**DAVID**: Feel the power of your own desire  
**CLAIRE**: Feel the danger, feel the fire  
**BOTH**: This is where your real life starts  
**BOTH**: This is where you trust your heart  

### **Outro - CLAIRE**
*(Music fading, her decision)*

*(Whispered, almost to herself)*
No panties tomorrow...  

*(Looking at him directly)*
What else?  

**DAVID**: *(smiling)*
That's my girl  

*(Music ends)*

## Performance Notes

### **Vocal Considerations**
- **Claire's Range**: Mezzo-soprano, G3 to F#5
- **David's Range**: Baritone, F2 to F4
- **Harmony**: Complex interweaving in final chorus
- **Emotional Arc**: From playful to intense to committed

### **Acting Beats**
1. **Flirtation**: Wine-fueled attraction and banter
2. **Recognition**: David sees through Claire's mask
3. **Awakening**: Claire feels alive for the first time in years
4. **The Command**: David establishes dominance
5. **Resistance**: Claire's fear and conditioning fight back
6. **Surrender**: Claire chooses to trust and submit

### **Choreography Notes**
- **Party Dancing**: Starts casual, becomes more intimate
- **Power Dynamics**: David leads, Claire follows, then resists, then chooses
- **Spatial Relationships**: Use of levels, proximity, and positioning to show power
- **Sensual Movement**: Tasteful but clearly sexual choreography
- **The Moment**: Claire's decision should be visible in her body language

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Intimate Staging**: Requires actors comfortable with close physical work
- **Lighting**: Transition from party atmosphere to intimate focus
- **Sound**: Music must support both conversation and singing
- **Safety**: All physical choreography must be carefully rehearsed

### **Costume Notes**
- **Claire**: Party dress that allows for movement, gradually becoming disheveled
- **David**: Casual but commanding presence, clothes that suggest control
- **Progression**: Costumes should reflect the power shift happening

## Director's Notes

This song is the turning point of the entire musical. It must establish the D/s dynamic clearly while showing that Claire is making a choice, not being coerced. David's dominance should feel magnetic and safe, not threatening.

The audience should understand that this is about Claire reclaiming her sexuality and agency, not about her being victimized. The power exchange should feel consensual and exciting, not abusive.

The "no panties" command should feel like a gift David is giving Claire - permission to feel sexy and alive again - rather than a degrading demand.

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

### **BDSM Representation**
- Consult with actual BDSM educators and practitioners
- Show clear distinction between dominance and abuse
- Emphasize consent, communication, and care
- Avoid stereotypes about power exchange relationships

### **Female Sexuality**
- Respect Claire's journey without slut-shaming or madonna/whore complex
- Show that wanting to be dominated doesn't make her weak
- Address the complexity of female desire in a post-#MeToo world

### **Suburban Authenticity**
- Based on real experiences of suburban women
- Avoid condescending to the lifestyle while critiquing its limitations
- Honor the real struggles of midlife identity crisis

- Explicit sexual themes and language
- Power dynamic/BDSM content
- Adult themes of infidelity and marriage issues
- Mature content not suitable for younger audiences

## The Deeper Meaning

"No Panties Tomorrow" is about more than sexual awakening - it's about Claire reclaiming her right to want things, to feel things, to be more than just a perfect performance. David's command isn't really about underwear - it's about giving her permission to be imperfect, to be human, to be alive.

The song should leave the audience understanding that Claire is choosing to explore a part of herself she's denied for decades, and that this choice - however dangerous - is an act of self-determination, not self-destruction.

**This is where Claire's real story begins.**
