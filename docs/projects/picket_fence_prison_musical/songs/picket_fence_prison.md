## LYRICS

### **Verse 1**
*(Claire moves through her morning routine with mechanical precision)*

Coffee at seven, yoga at eight  
Volunteer meeting, can't be late  
Check the Ring camera, wave at the street  
Perfect performance, rinse and repeat  

*(She pauses, looking at herself in the hallway mirror)*

Twenty-five years of the same routine  
Playing the part of suburban queen  
But when did I stop and when did I start  
Just going through motions without any heart?  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(The music builds, her movements become more agitated)*

I used to dream of something more  
Than matching towels and marble floors  
I used to burn, I used to feel  
Now nothing here seems even real  

### **Chorus**
*(Full voice, the truth breaking through)*

These picket fences feel like bars  
And this dream house is my prison yard  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But I'm dying inside this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Are the walls of my suburban prison  

### **Verse 2**
*(She moves to the kitchen, starts making Michael's lunch)*

Michael's lunch packed, his coffee poured  
He'll grunt "thanks babe" and head out the door  
Twenty years married, we barely speak  
Just two strangers sharing the same technique  

*(She looks at family photos on the refrigerator)*

The girls are at college, living their dreams  
While I'm still here, bursting at the seams  
They think I'm happy, they think I'm fine  
But I'm disappearing one day at a time  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(Building intensity, she starts throwing things into cabinets)*

I used to matter, I used to count  
Now I'm just keeping someone else's house  
I used to laugh, I used to cry  
Now I just smile and wonder why  

### **Chorus**
*(Even more desperate, movements becoming erratic)*

These picket fences feel like bars  
And this dream house is my prison yard  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But I'm dying inside this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Are the walls of my suburban prison  

### **Bridge**
*(Music drops to almost nothing, Claire sits at kitchen table)*

*(Spoken, almost to herself)*
When did I become so small?  
When did I stop wanting anything at all?  

*(Sung, building)*
I used to have opinions, I used to have fire  
I used to have dreams that could lift me higher  
Now I volunteer for other people's causes  
While my own life just stops and pauses  

*(Standing, voice growing stronger)*
There's got to be more than this  
There's got to be something I've missed  
Some part of me that's still alive  
Some reason to more than just survive  

### **Final Chorus**
*(Full orchestra, Claire's voice soaring with desperation and hope)*

These picket fences feel like bars  
But maybe I can see the stars  
I'm serving time for a crime I didn't commit  
Being the woman I thought I was supposed to be  

Perfect lawn, perfect life, perfect wife  
But there's something burning in this perfect life  
These picket fences, white and clean  
Won't be the walls of my suburban prison  

*(Music builds to climax)*

Not anymore...  
Not anymore...  
There's got to be something more...  

### **Outro**
*(Music fades to single piano, Claire looking out the window)*

*(Whispered)*
There's got to be something more...  

*(The doorbell rings - David Sterling is at the door with a package)*

## Performance Notes

### **Vocal Considerations**
- **Range**: G3 to G5, sitting comfortably in mezzo range
- **Breath Control**: Long phrases in chorus require strong support
- **Emotional Arc**: From mechanical to desperate to hopeful
- **Diction**: Clear storytelling in verses, soaring emotion in chorus

### **Acting Beats**
1. **Mechanical Routine**: Show the emptiness through perfection
2. **Growing Awareness**: Let cracks show in the facade
3. **Desperate Realization**: The prison becomes visible
4. **Emerging Hope**: Something is stirring beneath the surface
5. **Interrupted Moment**: David's arrival changes everything

### **Choreography Notes**
- **Domestic Movements**: Coffee making, bed making, phone checking become dance
- **Repetitive Patterns**: Show the prison of routine through repeated gestures
- **Breaking Free**: Movements become larger and more expressive
- **Stillness**: Moments of complete stop for emotional impact
- **Transition**: End position sets up for David's entrance

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Set Changes**: Kitchen to living room to front door
- **Props**: Must be dance-friendly and safe
- **Lighting**: Shifts from bright domestic to more dramatic
- **Sound**: Ring doorbell cue must be perfectly timed

### **Costume Notes**
- **Starting Look**: Perfect athleisure, every hair in place
- **Progression**: Clothing becomes slightly disheveled as emotion builds
- **Colors**: Start with safe neutrals, add hints of deeper colors
- **Accessories**: Wedding ring, fitness tracker, perfect manicure

## Director's Notes

This song establishes Claire as a complex character, not a victim. She's trapped, but she's also complicit in her own imprisonment. The audience should feel sympathy for her situation while recognizing her agency in creating it.

The domestic choreography should feel both beautiful and suffocating - the prison of perfection. By the end, we should see glimpses of the passionate woman she used to be, setting up her journey for the rest of the show.

The arrival of David at the end should feel like fate - the universe responding to her desperate plea for "something more."

## Cultural Authenticity Notes

### **Irish-Catholic Elements**
- Subtle references to guilt and duty without stereotyping
- The weight of family expectations and "proper" behavior
- Connection between sexuality and shame that will be explored throughout

### **Suburban Reality**
- Based on real experiences of empty-nest syndrome
- Authentic details of upper-middle-class suburban life
- The isolation that can exist within apparent community

### **Female Experience**
- Honest portrayal of midlife identity crisis
- The challenge of redefining yourself after children leave
- The complexity of marriage after decades together

**This song sets the stage for a journey that will challenge both Claire and the audience to examine what we sacrifice for the appearance of perfection.**
