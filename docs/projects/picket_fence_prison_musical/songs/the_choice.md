## LYRICS

### **Verse 1**
*(Claire sitting on her bed, wedding ring in her palm)*

Twenty years of marriage in this little gold band  
Twenty years of being who he needed me to be  
The perfect wife, the perfect mother, everything planned  
But I've never been the woman that I need to be  

*(Looking at family photos)*

The girls are grown and gone, living their own dreams  
While I've been living someone else's version of mine  
Michael wants the woman from our wedding scenes  
But she's been dying slowly, line by line  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(Standing, moving to the window)*

I can stay and keep pretending  
That this half-life is enough  
Or I can choose the woman I'm becoming  
Even if the choice is rough  

### **Chorus**
*(Building, voice becoming stronger)*

This is the choice between the woman I was  
And the woman I'm becoming  
Between the safety of the known  
And the truth that's been humming  

In my bones, in my blood  
In the parts of me that David sees  
I can choose the comfortable lie  
Or I can choose to be free  

### **Verse 2**
*(Moving through the room, touching memories)*

I see the life we built, the house, the perfect lawn  
The Christmas cards with smiling faces, all in a row  
But I also see the woman who's been dead and gone  
For twenty years, and now she wants to grow  

*(Picking up her phone, David's text)*

He's not asking me to choose him over them  
He's asking me to choose myself over fear  
To stop apologizing for who I am  
And start living the truth that's crystal clear  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(Voice growing stronger)*

I can stay and keep pretending  
That this half-life is enough  
Or I can choose the woman I'm becoming  
Even if the choice is rough  

### **Chorus**
*(More powerful)*

This is the choice between the woman I was  
And the woman I'm becoming  
Between the safety of the known  
And the truth that's been humming  

In my bones, in my blood  
In the parts of me that David sees  
I can choose the comfortable lie  
Or I can choose to be free  

### **Bridge - The Internal Battle**
*(Music drops, internal dialogue)*

*(Spoken)*
What will people say?  
What will my daughters think?  
How can I throw away  
Everything we built?  

*(Sung, building)*
But what's the point of building  
A life that isn't mine?  
What's the point of staying  
When I'm dying by design?  

*(Voice soaring)*
I've spent my whole life asking  
"What do they need from me?"  
Maybe it's time to ask  
"What do I need to be?"  

### **Verse 3 - The Decision**
*(Moving with purpose, packing a bag)*

I'm not leaving to hurt him  
I'm leaving to save myself  
From disappearing completely  
Into someone else  

*(Taking off wedding ring)*

This ring was a promise  
To love, honor, and obey  
But I never promised  
To fade away  

### **Final Chorus - Resolution**
*(Full orchestra, voice at its most powerful)*

This is the choice between the woman I was  
And the woman I'm becoming  
Between the safety of the known  
And the truth that's been humming  

In my bones, in my blood  
In the parts of me that David freed  
I choose the uncomfortable truth  
I choose what I need  

### **Outro - The New Beginning**
*(Music becoming hopeful, Claire at the door)*

*(Sung with quiet certainty)*
I choose the woman I'm becoming  
Over the woman I was  
I choose love over safety  
I choose truth over because  

*(Spoken, to her reflection)*
"That's how it's always been done"  

*(Sung, final note)*
I choose to be alive  
Instead of just surviving  
I choose to be myself  
Instead of just complying  

*(She picks up her bag and walks toward the door)*

I choose...  
*(Door closes)*

## Director's Notes

This is Claire's defining moment - the choice that determines who she becomes. It's crucial that the audience understands this isn't just about choosing between two men, but about choosing between two versions of herself.

The song should feel like a genuine internal struggle, not a foregone conclusion. Claire must weigh the real costs of her choice - losing her family, her social standing, her security - against the cost of staying and continuing to disappear.

The ending should feel both triumphant and bittersweet. She's choosing authenticity, but at a real price.

## The Deeper Meaning

"The Choice" is about the moment when a woman decides to save herself instead of saving everyone else's comfort. Claire's decision isn't about David specifically - it's about choosing to be real instead of performing a role that's killing her.

The song honors both the difficulty of her choice and the necessity of it. She's not abandoning her responsibilities; she's refusing to abandon herself.

This is the moment Claire stops asking "What do they need from me?" and starts asking "What do I need to be whole?"

**This is where Claire chooses life over safety, truth over comfort, herself over everyone else's expectations.**
