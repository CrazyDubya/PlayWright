## LYRICS

### **Verse 1 - The Justification**
*(Michael at his computer, defensive)*

I'm not a bad guy, I'm just a man  
With needs that my wife doesn't understand  
She's always tired, always stressed  
Always something, never undressed  

*(Clicking through Jessica's content)*

So I found a little outlet  
A harmless way to cope  
Just some videos, some pictures  
Nothing more than digital hope  

That somewhere there's a woman  
Who actually wants to please  
Who doesn't make me beg for attention  
Who gets down on her knees  

### **Pre-Chorus**
It's not cheating if it's pixels  
It's not wrong if no one knows  
It's just entertainment, just a service  
That's how the internet goes  

### **Chorus - Customer #247**
*(Building shame and defensiveness)*

I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
On a website selling heaven  
To suburban guys like me  
Who pay for what we'll never see  

At home, in our own beds  
With our wives who've given up  
I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
Drinking from a poisoned cup  

But it's legal, it's consensual  
She's making money, I'm having fun  
I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
I'm not the only one  

### **Verse 2 - The Escalation**
*(Getting more involved, more defensive)*

Started with the basic subscription  
Twenty bucks a month, no big deal  
Then the custom videos started  
Making everything feel more real  

*(Typing requests)*

"Say my name, wear this outfit  
Pretend that you're my neighbor  
Do the things my wife won't do  
Be my digital savior"  

Fifty here, a hundred there  
For personalized attention  
She knows exactly what I want  
Without me having to mention  

That I'm married, that I'm lonely  
That I live right down the street  
That I watch her every morning  
When she gets her mail in heat  

### **Bridge - The Recognition**
*(Music becoming more frantic)*

Wait... is that Claire in the background?  
Wait... is that David's voice?  
Wait... is my wife involved  
In Jessica's sexual choice?  

*(Panic setting in)*
Oh God, what if she finds out?  
What if the neighbors know?  
What if my credit card statements  
Reveal where my money goes?  

What if Jessica recognizes  
My requests, my specific needs?  
What if she connects the dots  
Between my payments and my deeds?  

### **Verse 3 - The Exposure**
*(Desperate, trying to cover tracks)*

Delete the browser history  
Clear the credit card records  
Hide the phone, destroy the evidence  
Of my digital discord  

But it's too late, they're all talking  
About David and the wives  
About Jessica's content creation  
About their secret lives  

*(Realization dawning)*
And I'm part of it, I funded it  
I paid for her degradation  
While judging her publicly  
For her sexual liberation  

I'm the demand that created supply  
I'm the market that she serves  
I'm the reason she's performing  
What my own wife reserves  

### **Final Chorus - The Shame**
*(Full orchestra, complete breakdown)*

I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
But I'm going straight to hell  
For paying for my neighbor's body  
While my marriage goes to hell  

I'm a hypocrite, I'm a coward  
I'm everything that's wrong  
With suburban male entitlement  
I've been singing the wrong song  

About family values, about morality  
While I pay for digital sin  
I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
And the shame is caving in  

### **Outro - The Fade**
*(Music dying, Michael's voice becoming smaller)*

*(Spoken, to himself)*
How do I face Claire now?  
How do I face myself?  
How do I explain that I've been buying  
What I couldn't find on my own shelf?  

*(Sung, barely audible)*
Customer number two-four-seven  
Just another suburban lie  
Paying for someone else's heaven  
While my own marriage dies  

Customer number two-four-seven  
Anonymous but known  
In the end, we're all just customers  
Buying what we can't own  

*(Final click - computer shutting down)*

## Director's Notes

This song must show Michael as both pathetic and representative of a larger problem. He's not evil, but he's complicit in a system that exploits women while claiming to protect them.

The audience should recognize Michael's behavior as common suburban male hypocrisy - publicly supporting family values while privately consuming what they publicly condemn.

The song should feel uncomfortable but not preachy - Michael's shame should feel earned, not imposed.

## The Deeper Meaning

"Customer #247" reveals the demand side of Jessica's exploitation. Michael represents the suburban men who create the market for commodified female sexuality while publicly condemning it.

His shame comes not from consuming Jessica's content, but from being exposed as a hypocrite. He's more concerned with his reputation than with the harm his consumption enables.

The song shows how the entire suburban community is economically invested in Jessica's degradation while morally condemning it - the perfect capitalist contradiction.

**This is where the musical exposes the customers behind the exploitation, showing how suburban moral panic coexists with suburban economic enablement, and how every neighbor is complicit in the system they claim to oppose.**
