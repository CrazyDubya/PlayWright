## LYRICS

### **Opening - Intimate Scene**
*(David and Claire in bed, post-"Marionette" scene)*

**CLAIRE**: *(soft, vulnerable)*
I've never felt so safe in someone's arms  
Never trusted anyone this far  
You've shown me parts of myself I'd forgotten  
Parts I thought were lost, but here they are  

**DAVID**: *(tender)*
You're beautiful when you let yourself be seen  
Not performing, not pretending  
Just Claire, just real, just—  

*(His phone buzzes urgently)*

### **The Interruption**
**DAVID**: *(checking phone, face changing)*
Shit. Jessica.  

**CLAIRE**: *(confused)*
What about Jessica?  

**DAVID**: *(reading frantically)*
"Help me. Hotel room. He won't stop. Please."  

### **Verse 1 - The Realization**
**CLAIRE**: *(sitting up)*
You have to go to her  

**DAVID**: *(torn)*
Claire, this is our night  
This is what we've been building to  
I can't just—  

**CLAIRE**: *(firmly)*
You have to go to her  
She's in danger because of the games you started  
You created this, now you have to—  

**DAVID**: *(already moving)*
I'll be back, I promise  
This doesn't change what we—  

**CLAIRE**: *(alone)*
Go.  

### **Cross-Cut - Hotel Room**
*(Jessica's voice, terrified)*

**JESSICA**: *(off-stage, desperate)*
I said no! I said the safe word!  
This isn't what we agreed!  
You're hurting me, please stop!  

**STRANGER**: *(menacing)*
You're a whore, you don't get to say no  
I paid for this, I own you tonight  
Your little videos promised everything  
Now deliver, bitch, or I'll make you—  

### **David's Journey - Sung**
*(David driving, Claire alone)*

**DAVID**: *(urgent)*
Faster, faster, through the suburban streets  
Past the perfect lawns and perfect lives  
While a woman screams in a hotel room  
Because I taught her to commodify  
Her desire, her body, her soul  

**CLAIRE**: *(alone in bed)*
And here I am, naked and waiting  
For a man who runs to save other women  
From the consequences of his games  
What does that make me?  
What does that make this?  

### **The Rescue - Action Sequence**
*(David arrives at hotel)*

**DAVID**: *(pounding on door)*
Jessica! Open the door!  

**STRANGER**: *(from inside)*
Go away! We're busy!  

**JESSICA**: *(screaming)*
David! Help me!  

*(Sound of door breaking)*

**DAVID**: *(commanding)*
Get away from her. NOW.  

**STRANGER**: *(backing down)*
Hey man, she's a prostitute  
I paid for this, she advertised—  

**DAVID**: *(dangerous)*
She said no. That means no.  
Get out before I call the police.  
Or before I do something  
That will make you wish I had.  

### **The Aftermath - Duet**
*(David comforting Jessica)*

**JESSICA**: *(broken)*
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was empowered  
I thought selling my body  
Meant I owned my power  

But he was so much stronger  
And he didn't care what I wanted  
He saw my videos and thought  
That meant I could be hunted  

**DAVID**: *(guilty)*
This is my fault  
I encouraged your performance  
I fed your need for validation  
I created this distortion  

Of what power actually means  
Of what submission actually is  
You were never my submissive  
You were just my business  

### **Claire's Realization - Solo**
*(Back in David's bedroom)*

**CLAIRE**: *(growing understanding)*
And here I am, waiting  
Like a good girl, like a pet  
For my master to return  
From saving his other asset  

Is this what I am to him?  
Another woman in his collection?  
Another suburban housewife  
Needing his protection?  

*(Building anger)*
Or am I different?  
Am I special?  
Am I the real one  
While she's just the vessel  

For his need to feel powerful  
To feel needed, to feel strong?  
God, what if I'm just another  
Jessica, and I've been wrong  

About everything I thought  
This relationship could be?  
What if his rescue of her  
Is just more manipulation of me?  

### **David's Return**
*(David enters, exhausted)*

**DAVID**: 
Claire, I'm sorry  
I had to—  

**CLAIRE**: *(cold)*
How is she?  

**DAVID**: 
Shaken. Hurt. But safe.  
She's coming home with us.  

**CLAIRE**: 
Home with us?  

**DAVID**: 
She can't go back to Robert  
She can't be alone tonight  
She needs—  

**CLAIRE**: *(standing)*
She needs what, David?  
Your protection? Your control?  
Another woman who can't function  
Without you playing the hero role?  

### **Final Confrontation**
**DAVID**: 
That's not what this is  

**CLAIRE**: 
Isn't it?  
You created the situation that put her in danger  
Then you rescued her from it  
Now she's grateful, dependent, a stranger  
To her own agency  

And here I am, naked in your bed  
Waiting for you to come back  
From saving another woman  
From the consequences of your attack  

On her sense of self  
On her understanding of power  
Tell me, David, in this moment  
Who's really in control this hour?  

### **Outro - Unresolved**
*(Jessica enters, wrapped in David's coat)*

**JESSICA**: *(small voice)*
Thank you  
Both of you  
I don't know what I would have done  

**CLAIRE**: *(looking between them)*
I think I do.  

*(Music ends on unresolved chord)*

## Performance Notes

### **Staging Complexity**
- **Split Stage**: Requires sophisticated set design for simultaneous action
- **Quick Transitions**: David must move between spaces rapidly
- **Safety**: All physical confrontation must be carefully choreographed
- **Emotional Range**: All three characters go through major emotional shifts

### **Vocal Demands**
- **David**: Must sing while in physical action
- **Claire**: Solo sections require strong acting through song
- **Jessica**: Vulnerable and broken vocal quality
- **Ensemble**: Stranger must be menacing but not cartoonish

## Director's Notes

This is the turning point of the entire musical. The audience must see:
1. David's genuine care for Jessica's safety
2. His responsibility for creating the dangerous situation
3. Claire's growing awareness of the power dynamics
4. Jessica's complete vulnerability and dependence

The rescue should feel heroic and problematic simultaneously. David saves Jessica, but he also created the need for rescue. Claire's realization that she might be just another woman in David's collection should be devastating.

The song sets up the final act where all three characters must reckon with the true nature of their relationships.

**This is where the love story becomes a power story, where rescue becomes another form of control, and where Claire must decide if she's a partner or just another project.**
