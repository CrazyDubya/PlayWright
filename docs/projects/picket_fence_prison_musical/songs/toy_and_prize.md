## LYRICS

### **Verse 1 - Jessica (The Toy)**
*(Cold, calculated)*

Jessica is simple, Jessica is clear  
A broken little toy that I keep here  
For my amusement, for my use  
Easy to control, easy to abuse  

*(Mechanical)*
Wind her up and watch her dance  
Give her money, give her chance  
To feel special, feel desired  
While I pull the strings I've wired  

Into her adoption trauma  
Into her desperate need for drama  
She's a toy, just a toy  
Built for my destructive joy  

### **Pre-Chorus**
I know exactly what she is  
I know exactly what I'm doing  
She's entertainment, she's a business  
She's a game that I'm pursuing  

### **Chorus - The Confusion**
*(Music shifting, becoming more complex)*

But Claire... Claire is different  
Claire was never meant to be  
More than just another toy  
In my suburban inventory  

But Claire... Claire is different  
And I don't know what that means  
When a predator finds a prize  
In his collection of broken things  

### **Verse 2 - Claire (The Prize)**
*(Warmer, more confused)*

Claire was an accident, a moment's whim  
Too much wine, her guard grew thin  
I gave a command, she obeyed  
And something in me... changed  

*(Growing intensity)*
She wasn't supposed to matter  
She wasn't supposed to be real  
She was supposed to be another  
Broken thing for me to steal  

But when she looks at me with trust  
When she surrenders to my touch  
I feel something I don't recognize  
Something that terrifies  

### **Bridge - The Internal War**
*(Music becoming chaotic)*

What is this feeling?  
What is this need?  
To protect her, to keep her  
To actually feed  

Her growth, her pleasure  
Not just my own  
To build her up  
Not tear her down  

*(Building panic)*
This isn't how this works  
This isn't who I am  
I'm the man who breaks Jessica  
I'm not supposed to understand  

Love, or care, or genuine connection  
I'm supposed to be above  
The messy complications  
Of actually falling in love  

### **Verse 3 - The Realization**
*(Desperate)*

Jessica sees me as I am  
A user, a manipulator  
She loves me for my cruelty  
She's my willing collaborator  

But Claire... Claire sees something else  
Something I'm not sure exists  
A man who could love without destroying  
A Dom who could care without twists  

*(Voice breaking)*
What if she's wrong about me?  
What if I'm exactly what Jessica sees?  
What if this feeling is just another  
Way to bring Claire to her knees?  

### **Final Chorus - No Resolution**
*(Full orchestra, no resolution)*

Claire is different, Claire is different  
But I don't know if I can be  
The man she thinks she's surrendering to  
Or just another predator, like me  

Jessica is my toy, my creation  
Claire is my prize, my confusion  
One I control completely  
One controls my delusion  

That I could be something more  
Than the monster that I am  
That I could love without destroying  
That I could be a better man  

### **Outro - The Question**
*(Music fading, unresolved)*

*(Spoken, to himself)*
What happens when a predator  
Falls for his prey?  
What happens when a monster  
Wants to change his way?  

*(Sung, quietly)*
Jessica is my toy  
Claire is my prize  
But which one shows me  
Who I really am inside?  

*(Final unresolved chord)*

## Performance Notes

### **Vocal Considerations**
- **Range**: Baritone, F2 to F4, with emotional strain in upper register
- **Acting**: Must show genuine confusion without losing his predatory edge
- **Emotional Arc**: Cold calculation to genuine confusion to desperate uncertainty
- **No Resolution**: The song ends without David understanding himself

### **Musical Structure**
- **Jessica sections**: Mechanical, cold, controlled music
- **Claire sections**: Warmer, more complex harmonies
- **Bridge**: Chaotic, showing internal conflict
- **No resolution**: Song ends on unresolved chord

## Director's Notes

This song must show David as genuinely confused without making him sympathetic. He's still a predator - he's just a predator who accidentally found something real and doesn't know what to do with it.

The audience should understand that David's confusion doesn't excuse his treatment of Jessica. If anything, it makes it worse - he knows the difference between love and manipulation, he just chooses manipulation with Jessica because it's easier.

The song should leave the audience questioning whether David is capable of change or if his "love" for Claire is just a more sophisticated form of manipulation.

## The Deeper Meaning

"Toy and Prize" shows how predators can confuse themselves when they encounter genuine connection. David's confusion doesn't make him less dangerous - it makes him more unpredictable.

The song reveals that David knows exactly what he's doing to Jessica (she's a toy) but doesn't understand what's happening with Claire (she's a prize). This distinction is crucial - his cruelty to Jessica is intentional, his feelings for Claire are accidental.

The lack of resolution in the song reflects David's inability to understand himself. He's a predator who's encountered something that doesn't fit his worldview, and he doesn't know how to process it.

**This is where the musical shows that even predators can be confused by genuine connection, but confusion doesn't equal redemption.**
