## LYRICS

### **Verse 1 - The Setup**
*(Rosa enters, cleaning supplies in hand, surveying the wreckage)*

You want to know the truth? I'll give you the truth  
About your little suburban soap opera here  
You think you're so complex, so deep, so profound  
But I've been watching, and let me be clear  

I clean your houses, I see your lies  
I watch you perform while your marriages die  
I know your secrets, I know your games  
And I'm tired of listening to your complaints  

### **Pre-Chorus**
You had everything, everything  
Love and money and family  
But you threw it all away  
For your selfish fantasy  

### **Chorus - The Judgment**
*(Building power)*

You're not victims, you're not heroes  
You're just people with first-world problems and egos  
You had everything and you chose to destroy it  
For drama, for pleasure, for whatever you call it  

Don't come crying when it all falls apart  
You broke your own lives, you broke your own hearts  
I'll clean up the mess like I always do  
But I won't pretend to feel sorry for you  

### **Verse 2 - Claire's Judgment**
*(Turning to Claire)*

Claire, you had a husband who worked every day  
To give you this house, this life, this way  
Of living in comfort while you sat and pouted  
About feeling invisible, feeling doubted  

You want to know invisible? Let me tell you about invisible  
I've cleaned your house for five years straight  
Do you know my last name? Do you know if I have children?  
Do you know anything beyond what I do for your sake?  

That's invisible, señora  
You were just ignored  
There's a difference between being unseen  
And being bored  

### **Verse 3 - Jessica's Judgment**
*(Turning to Jessica)*

Jessica, you sold your body for attention and cash  
While calling it empowerment - what a load of trash  
You had a husband, you had a home  
But you chose to perform for strangers alone  

You think that collar makes you special?  
You think that money makes you free?  
You're just a broken little girl  
Playing dress-up for men to see  

### **Verse 4 - David's Judgment**
*(Turning to David)*

David, you're a predator with a sad story  
Using your grief to justify your glory  
Your wife died, yes, that's tragic and real  
But it doesn't excuse the way you steal  

Other people's lives for your control  
Other people's pain to fill the hole  
Where your heart used to be  
Before you chose cruelty  

### **Verse 5 - Michael's Judgment**
*(Turning to Michael)*

Michael, you checked out when life got hard  
Left your wife alone in your own backyard  
Three babies died, yes, that broke your heart  
But you chose to fall apart  

Instead of holding her, you held your phone  
Instead of facing grief, you left her alone  
Real men don't run when the going gets tough  
Real men stay and do the work, even when it's rough  

### **Bridge - The Community**
*(Turning to the ensemble)*

And the neighbors? You're all just as bad  
Watching the show while pretending you're mad  
Paying for content while judging the source  
Hypocrites all, without any remorse  

You funded her degradation  
While claiming moral indignation  
You consumed their pain for entertainment  
While preaching about commitment  

### **Final Chorus - The Complete Slaying**
*(Full power, mariachi horns blazing)*

You're not victims, you're not heroes  
You're just spoiled children with first-world problems and egos  
You had everything - love, money, family, youth  
And you threw it away, and that's the truth  

So don't come crying when it all falls apart  
You broke your own lives, you broke your own hearts  
I've seen real problems, I've seen real pain  
Not this suburban, privileged refrain  

### **Outro - The Final Word**
*(Music building to climax)*

You want validation for your selfish choices?  
Well, here's the truth from one of the invisible voices:  

*(Spoken, with music underneath)*
My sister has cancer and no insurance  
My nephew's in jail and I can't afford a lawyer  
My mother needs medicine that costs more than I make in a month  
I work three jobs just to send money home  

*(Sung, with full orchestra)*
THOSE are problems  
THOSE are struggles  
THOSE are reasons to cry  

Your boredom, your emptiness, your need to feel special?  
Those are choices  
Those are luxuries  
Those are lies  

*(Final powerful note)*
So clean up your own mess  
And stop expecting sympathy  
From people who know what real problems look like  

*(Music ends abruptly)*

## Director's Notes

This song must feel like a cleansing fire. Rosa isn't cruel - she's honest. She's not punishing them - she's refusing to enable their self-pity.

The audience should cheer when Rosa destroys their narratives because she's saying what everyone's thinking. These characters have had every advantage and thrown it away for drama.

Rosa represents the moral center the musical has been missing. She doesn't excuse their behavior because of their trauma - she calls them out for their choices.

## Cultural Authenticity Notes

### **Rosa's Background**
- Research actual experiences of Mexican immigrant housekeepers
- Understand the economic pressures and family obligations
- Show her strength without making her a stereotype
- Honor her dignity while showing her frustration

### **Musical Elements**
- Incorporate authentic mariachi instrumentation
- Use Spanish phrases naturally, not for effect
- Show her cultural pride alongside her moral authority
- Avoid stereotypical "spicy Latina" tropes

## The Deeper Meaning

"The Reckoning" is the musical's moral climax. Rosa strips away all the psychological justifications and trauma explanations to reveal the simple truth: these are privileged people who made selfish choices.

She doesn't deny their pain or trauma, but she refuses to let it excuse their behavior. Her perspective - as someone with real problems - puts their "struggles" in context.

The song serves as the audience's catharsis. After watching these characters justify their harmful behavior for two acts, Rosa finally says what everyone's thinking: "You had everything and you threw it away. Don't expect sympathy."

**This is where the musical stops being about complex moral questions and becomes about simple moral truth: actions have consequences, choices matter, and privilege doesn't excuse selfishness.**

**Rosa doesn't just judge the characters - she judges the culture that created them. A culture that values individual fulfillment over commitment, that excuses harmful behavior with therapy speak, that confuses trauma explanations with moral justifications.**

**The audience leaves not with questions about moral complexity, but with clarity about moral responsibility.**
