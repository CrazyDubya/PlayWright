## LYRICS

### **Verse 1**
*(Jessica in her luxury accessories, but peaceful)*

I spent my whole life trying to fit  
Into spaces that were never meant for me  
Adopted daughter, perfect wife  
Playing roles that set me free  
From having to discover  
Who I actually am  

But here, in this collar  
Here, serving at their feet  
Here, being their pet  
I finally feel complete  

### **Pre-Chorus**
You think this is degrading  
You think this makes me small  
But I've never felt more valued  
I've never felt more tall  

### **Chorus**
This is where I belong  
In the spaces between your definitions  
This is where I'm strong  
In my chosen submission  
You can keep your liberation  
You can keep your empowerment  
I found my salvation  
In this strange arrangement  

This is where I belong  
This is where I belong  

### **Verse 2**
*(Growing confidence)*

I make more money than most CEOs  
I'm pampered like a queen  
I'm wanted, I'm desired  
I'm part of something serene  
That you can't understand  
Because you need to judge  

But I don't need your approval  
I don't need your concern  
I found what I was looking for  
And I'm not going to return  
To the world that never wanted  
The real me anyway  

### **Bridge**
*(Building to powerful acceptance)*

I was never going to be  
The daughter they dreamed of  
I was never going to be  
The wife he could love  
I was never going to be  
The woman you respect  

But I can be their pet  
I can be their treasure  
I can be their pleasure  
And find my own measure  
Of worth in their eyes  
Of value in their care  
Of home in their arms  
Of belonging somewhere  

### **Final Chorus**
*(Full voice, completely at peace)*

This is where I belong  
In the spaces you can't see  
This is where I'm strong  
Being exactly who I need to be  
You can keep your liberation  
You can keep your judgment  
I found my destination  
In this beautiful arrangement  

This is where I belong  
This is where I belong  
And I'm not ashamed  
And I'm not afraid  
And I'm not broken  
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be  

### **Outro**
*(Soft, content)*

Some people find themselves in boardrooms  
Some people find themselves in love  
Some people find themselves in motherhood  
Some people find themselves above  
The need to be understood  
By anyone but themselves  

I found myself here  
In this collar, in this care  
In this service, in this prayer  
That I am enough  
Exactly as I am  
In this place where I belong
