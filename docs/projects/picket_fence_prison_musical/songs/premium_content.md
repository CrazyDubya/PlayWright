## LYRICS

### **Verse 1**
*(Jessica setting up equipment, excited)*

TikTok followers want to see more  
"Link in bio" leads them to my store  
"Premium content for my special fans"  
Twenty dollars gets you my OnlyFans  

*(Adjusting camera, checking lighting)*

Ring light perfect, camera's rolling  
"Hey daddy, your baby's feeling  
Like showing you what's underneath  
This suburban housewife's sheath"  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(Notification sounds, money rolling in)*

Cha-ching! Another subscription  
Cha-ching! Another transaction  
They're paying for my liberation  
This is female empowerment, right?  

### **Chorus**
*(Full energy, performing for camera)*

Welcome to my premium content  
Where your fantasies are my rent  
Every moan is monetized  
Every orgasm's advertised  

Suburban MILF, that's my brand  
Supply and demand, supply and demand  
Premium content, premium me  
This is what liberation looks like, can't you see?  

### **Verse 2**
*(More elaborate setup, costume changes)*

Custom videos, fifty bucks each  
"Tell me your fantasy, I'll make you reach"  
Anal's extra, hundred and twenty  
My body's a business, money's plenty  

*(Checking comments, requests getting more extreme)*

"Can you do this? Can you try that?"  
Each request adds to my bank account fat  
"You're so authentic, you're so real"  
But I'm just selling what they want to feel  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(More frantic, notifications overwhelming)*

Cha-ching! Another custom order  
Cha-ching! Crossing another border  
Of what I said I'd never do  
But the money's calling, what's a girl to do?  

### **Chorus**
*(More desperate energy)*

Welcome to my premium content  
Where your fantasies pay my rent  
Every boundary that I cross  
Is another financial boss  

Suburban MILF, that's my game  
Fortune and fame, fortune and fame  
Premium content, premium me  
This is what empowerment costs, can't you see?  

### **Bridge - The Escalation**
*(Music becomes darker, more mechanical)*

Started with just lingerie pics  
Now they want me with bigger dicks  
Started with solo masturbation  
Now they want live penetration  

*(Voice becoming more robotic)*

"Meet me in person, I'll pay double"  
"Real life meetup, worth the trouble"  
"Five thousand cash for one night"  
That's more than I make... that's more than I make...  

### **Verse 3 - The Temptation**
*(Slowing down, considering)*

Five thousand dollars for one evening  
That's my mortgage, that's my breathing  
Room to quit this digital dance  
Maybe this is my real chance  

*(Looking at the message)*

"Luxury hotel, you set the rules"  
"I'm not like those other fools"  
"I respect women, I'm a gentleman"  
"Just want to meet my favorite cam"  

### **Final Chorus - The Decision**
*(Building to climax)*

Welcome to my premium content  
Where reality pays the rent  
Every line that I have crossed  
Led me here, whatever the cost  

Suburban MILF, that's my fate  
Real life date, real life date  
Premium content, premium me  
This is what I've become, can't you see?  

### **Outro**
*(Music fading, Jessica typing response)*

*(Spoken, to herself)*
"Yes, I'll meet you. Send the details."  

*(Sung, quietly)*
What could go wrong?  
What could go wrong?  
I'm in control...  
I'm in control...  

*(Final notification ping)*

## Performance Notes

### **Vocal Considerations**
- **Range**: Soprano, C4 to C6, with breathless delivery
- **Energy**: High energy throughout, becoming frantic
- **Acting**: Must show the gradual loss of agency disguised as empowerment
- **Transitions**: Clear shifts between performing for camera and private moments

### **Staging Requirements**
- **Multiple Cameras**: Audience sees Jessica from different angles
- **Costume Changes**: Quick changes showing escalation
- **Props**: Professional content creation equipment
- **Technology**: Real-time notifications and money counters

### **Choreography Notes**
- **Content Creation**: Realistic OnlyFans-style poses and movements
- **Escalation**: Each section becomes more explicit
- **Mechanical**: Movements become more robotic as humanity is lost
- **Isolation**: Despite being "connected," Jessica is completely alone

## Director's Notes

This song must walk a careful line - showing the reality of online sex work without being exploitative or judgmental. Jessica believes she's empowered, but the audience should see her gradual dehumanization.

The staging should feel clinical and isolated despite the sexual content. The ring lights and cameras create a harsh, artificial environment that contrasts with Claire's intimate, authentic journey.

The song should generate sympathy for Jessica while showing how economic desperation and social media validation can lead to dangerous choices.

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

### **Sex Work Representation**
- Consult with actual OnlyFans creators about authentic experiences
- Avoid stigmatizing sex work while showing specific dangers of this situation
- Show economic pressures that drive these choices
- Distinguish between empowered sex work and exploitation

### **Social Media Reality**
- Based on real experiences of content creators
- Show the psychological toll of commodifying sexuality
- Address the blurred lines between empowerment and exploitation
- Realistic portrayal of online-to-offline dangers

## The Deeper Meaning

"Premium Content" shows how capitalism commodifies female sexuality under the guise of empowerment. Jessica believes she's in control, but she's actually being controlled by market forces and male desire.

The song contrasts with Claire's authentic sexual awakening - Jessica is performing sexuality for money while Claire is discovering it for herself. Both think they're being empowered, but only one is actually choosing her own path.

The escalation to the dangerous meetup shows how the commodification of sexuality can lead to real-world harm. Jessica's "empowerment" becomes her endangerment.

**This is where performed sexuality becomes dangerous sexuality, where the market's demand for "authentic" content pushes women toward increasingly risky behavior.**
