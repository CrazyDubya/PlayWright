## LYRICS

### **Opening - Spoken/Whispered**
*(Claire stands at the edge of the space, David behind her)*

**CLAIRE**: *(barely audible)*
I've spent my whole life holding on  
To control, to image, to being strong  
But what if strength isn't holding tight?  
What if it's learning to let go tonight?  

*(Music begins - single violin)*

### **Verse 1 - Sung Softly**
*(Claire begins to move, David's hands guiding her)*

Cut my strings of expectation  
Every role, every obligation  
Mother, wife, perfect neighbor  
Let me be something... other  

*(She raises her arms as if pulled by invisible strings)*

I've been dancing to their music  
All my life, automatic  
But these hands know different rhythms  
These ropes sing different hymns  

### **Pre-Chorus - Building**
*(Suspension preparation begins - ropes being positioned)*

Trust is harder than control  
Surrender deeper than the soul  
But in your hands I'm not breaking  
I'm finally... awakening  

### **Chorus - Suspension Begins**
*(Claire is lifted, becoming a living sculpture)*

I am floating, I am flying  
I am living, I am dying  
To the woman I used to be  
Now I'm dancing, finally free  

Marionette with willing strings  
Feel the power that surrender brings  
In your hands I find my grace  
In this vulnerable, sacred space  

### **Verse 2 - Aerial**
*(Claire moves through suspension, voice becoming stronger)*

Every rope a choice I'm making  
Every knot, my soul's awakening  
Not your puppet, not your toy  
But a woman finding joy  

*(Complex aerial choreography)*

In the space between the earth and sky  
Where truth lives and pretenses die  
I discover who I am  
When I stop giving a damn  

### **Pre-Chorus - Powerful**
*(Suspension becomes more complex, Claire's voice soars)*

Trust is stronger than my fear  
Surrender makes everything clear  
In your hands I'm not falling  
I'm finally... calling  

### **Chorus - Transcendent**
*(Full orchestra, Claire's voice at its most powerful)*

I am floating, I am flying  
I am living, I am dying  
To the woman I used to be  
Now I'm dancing, finally free  

Marionette with willing strings  
Feel the power that surrender brings  
In your hands I find my grace  
In this vulnerable, sacred space  

### **Bridge - The Revelation**
*(Music drops, Claire suspended in a moment of perfect stillness)*

*(Spoken, with growing intensity)*
This is what they never told me  
That power isn't always holding  
Sometimes it's the letting go  
Sometimes it's the not-knowing  

*(Sung, building)*
Every woman learns to carry  
The weight of others' expectations  
But here, suspended in your care  
I'm free from all those obligations  

*(Voice becoming operatic)*
I am not your possession  
I am not your obsession  
I am a woman choosing  
To trust without losing  
Myself in the surrender  
I become more tender  
And more powerful than before  
This is what I was looking for  

### **Final Chorus - Climactic**
*(Full company joins - David, ensemble representing her inner voices)*

**CLAIRE**: I am floating, I am flying  
**ENSEMBLE**: She is living, she is dying  
**ALL**: To the woman she used to be  
**CLAIRE**: Now I'm dancing, finally free  

**DAVID**: Marionette with willing strings  
**CLAIRE**: Feel the power that surrender brings  
**ALL**: In these hands she finds her grace  
**CLAIRE**: In this vulnerable, sacred space  

### **Outro - Return to Earth**
*(Claire is slowly lowered, music becoming intimate again)*

*(Whispered, as she touches the ground)*
I am not the same woman  
Who walked in here tonight  
I am not broken, I am not fixed  
I am simply... right  

*(Final note held as lights fade)*

## Director's Notes

This is the emotional and visual centerpiece of the entire musical. It must be executed with the highest level of artistry and safety. The suspension work should never feel exploitative or gratuitous - it serves the story of Claire's emotional and spiritual transformation.

The piece should feel like a religious experience - a moment of transcendence where Claire discovers her authentic self through the paradox of surrender. The audience should understand that this is about empowerment, not victimization.

The choreography must be developed in collaboration with BDSM educators and suspension experts to ensure authentic and safe representation of the practice.

## The Deeper Meaning

"Marionette" is about the paradox of finding freedom through surrender, power through vulnerability. Claire discovers that choosing to give up control is actually the ultimate act of self-determination.

The suspension work serves as a metaphor for trust, vulnerability, and transcendence. In allowing herself to be literally supported by another person, Claire learns to trust her own judgment and desires.

The piece should feel like a spiritual awakening - Claire connecting with parts of herself she's denied for decades. It's about integration, not transformation - becoming whole rather than becoming someone else.

The audience should leave this number understanding that Claire's journey is about authentic self-discovery, not about being "fixed" or "saved" by a man. David facilitates her journey, but the power and choice remain hers.

**This is where Claire stops performing her life and starts living it - suspended between earth and sky, between who she was and who she's becoming, finding grace in the space between.**
