## LYRICS

### **Verse 1 - The Response**
*(Claire stands up slowly, facing Rosa)*

You want to judge me, Rosa? Fine, let's talk about judgment  
You think you know my story because you clean my house?  
You think your suffering makes you superior?  
Let me tell you what this is really about  

You're angry because I had choices  
You're angry because I could choose  
To walk away from safety, from comfort  
To risk everything I could lose  

### **Pre-Chorus**
You call it privilege, I call it courage  
You call it selfish, I call it real  
You're mad because I felt something  
That you're too afraid to feel  

### **Chorus - The Declaration**
*(Building power)*

I choose to feel alive instead of dead inside  
I choose to want instead of just survive  
I choose to burn instead of slowly fade  
I choose the mess I made  

You can judge me, you can hate me  
You can call me what you want  
But I chose to live my life  
Instead of just going through the motions  

### **Verse 2 - Calling Out Rosa**
*(Direct confrontation)*

You talk about real problems, Rosa?  
Let me tell you about real problems  
Dying slowly in a perfect life  
While everyone tells you how lucky you are  

You work three jobs? I worked one job  
For twenty-five years - being perfect  
Being grateful, being quiet  
Being everything except myself  

You send money to your family?  
I sent my soul to the suburbs  
Piece by piece, year by year  
Until there was nothing left  

### **Bridge - The Audience Call-Out**
*(Turning to the audience)*

And you! You sitting there judging  
You came here to watch me break  
You wanted to see the whip across my back  
You wanted to watch me choke and shake  

You wanted to see Jessica crawl  
You wanted to see David's control  
You wanted to see the perfect wife fall  
You wanted to see me lose my soul  

*(Building intensity)*
But now that I chose it, now that I owned it  
Now that I said "this is what I want"  
You're angry because I'm not ashamed  
You're angry because I'm not broken  

### **Verse 3 - The Real Truth**
*(Full power)*

You want to know the real truth?  
You're all jealous of my choice  
You're jealous that I had the courage  
To listen to my own voice  

Rosa, you're jealous I could leave  
When your circumstances chain you down  
You're jealous I could risk everything  
While you're stuck in this town  

And you, audience, you're jealous too  
That I did what you only dream  
You live your safe little lives  
While judging those who dare to scream  

### **Final Chorus - The Defiant Declaration**
*(Full orchestra, rock elements)*

I choose to feel alive instead of dead inside  
I choose to want instead of just survive  
I choose to burn instead of slowly fade  
I choose the mess I made  

I choose the pain, I choose the pleasure  
I choose the risk, I choose the fall  
I choose to be a woman who wants  
Instead of having nothing at all  

### **Outro - The Final Stand**
*(Music building to climax)*

You can call me selfish, call me wrong  
You can say I threw my life away  
But I'd rather live one year as myself  
Than a lifetime as who you want me to be  

*(Spoken, with music underneath)*
I had a choice between dying slowly in comfort  
Or living dangerously as myself  

*(Sung, final powerful note)*
I choose myself  
I choose my desires  
I choose my life  
Even if it burns  

*(Music ends with defiant chord)*

## Director's Notes

This song must feel like Claire reclaiming her narrative. She's not apologizing or justifying - she's owning her choices and calling out everyone else's hypocrisy.

The audience address should feel shocking and direct. Claire breaks the fourth wall to confront the audience's own voyeuristic desires and moral superiority.

The song should leave the audience questioning their own judgment. Are they angry because Claire made bad choices, or because she made choices they're too afraid to make?

## The Counter-Argument

### **Against Rosa's Moral Authority**
- Rosa's anger comes from jealousy, not righteousness
- Her circumstances limit her choices, but that doesn't make her morally superior
- She judges Claire for having options she doesn't have

### **Against the Audience's Judgment**
- They came to see the spectacle, not to learn moral lessons
- They wanted to see Claire's degradation and submission
- They're angry she's not ashamed, not that she made bad choices
- Their judgment comes from their own repressed desires

### **For Claire's Agency**
- She chose authenticity over safety
- She chose feeling over numbness
- She chose risk over certainty
- She chose herself over others' expectations

## The Deeper Meaning

"I Choose" flips the entire moral framework of the musical. Instead of accepting judgment, Claire claims her agency and exposes everyone else's hypocrisy.

The song argues that choosing to live authentically - even destructively - is better than dying slowly in comfort. That wanting something is better than wanting nothing.

Claire's direct address to the audience forces them to confront their own voyeurism. They came to judge her choices while secretly envying her courage to make them.

The song doesn't argue that Claire's choices were right - it argues that they were hers to make, and that making them was better than making no choices at all.

**This is where the musical becomes truly complex - not because everyone has trauma, but because everyone has different definitions of what it means to live authentically.**

**Claire's final argument: "I'd rather live one year as myself than a lifetime as who you want me to be."**

**The audience must decide: Is she a selfish woman destroying her life, or a brave woman finally living it?**
