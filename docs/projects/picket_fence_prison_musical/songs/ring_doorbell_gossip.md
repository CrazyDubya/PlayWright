## LYRICS

### **Opening - The Notifications**
*(Sound of multiple doorbell notifications, neighbors checking phones)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: Did you see what happened at the Morrison's?  
**NEIGHBOR 2**: Ring doorbell caught it all  
**NEIGHBOR 3**: I've got the footage saved  
**NEIGHBOR 4**: Should we call?  
**ALL**: Nah, let's just watch and see what happens next  

### **Verse 1 - The Watching**
*(Overlapping voices, building rhythm)*

**WOMEN**: 
Motion detected, 2:47 AM  
Someone leaving David Sterling's again  
Is that Claire? Is that Jessica?  
Both of them? What's happening here?  

**MEN**: 
*(Still on phones/games)*
Whatever, babe, just keep it down  
I'm in the middle of this round  
As long as it doesn't affect  
Our property values, I don't care  

### **Pre-Chorus - The Justification**
**ALL**: 
We're not being nosy  
We're just being aware  
Community safety  
Means we have to care  
About what's happening  
In our neighborhood  
We're just looking out  
Like good neighbors should  

### **Chorus - Ring Doorbell Gossip**
*(Full ensemble, rapid-fire)*

Ring doorbell gossip, motion detected  
Every secret captured and collected  
High-def footage of their private shame  
We're all watching but we're not to blame  

For their choices, for their actions  
We're just passive, just reactions  
To the drama that they're creating  
While we're watching, while we're waiting  

For the climax, for the fall  
Ring doorbell gossip sees it all  
But we never intervene  
We just watch the drama on our screen  

### **Verse 2 - The Escalation**
**NEIGHBOR 5**: Did you see Jessica's OnlyFans?  
**NEIGHBOR 6**: My husband found the link  
**NEIGHBOR 7**: She's making bank off this scandal  
**NEIGHBOR 8**: What will people think?  

**NEIGHBOR 1**: About our neighborhood?  
**NEIGHBOR 2**: About our property values?  
**NEIGHBOR 3**: About our children?  
**NEIGHBOR 4**: About our family values?  

### **Bridge - The Moral Panic**
*(Music becomes more frantic)*

**WOMEN**: 
What if our daughters see this?  
What if they think it's normal?  
What if they start to believe  
That this behavior is formal  
Acceptable, even empowering?  
What message does this send?  

**MEN**: 
*(Looking up from phones)*
Wait, what's happening?  
Can someone explain?  
I wasn't really listening  
Can you start again?  

### **Verse 3 - The Intervention That Never Comes**
**NEIGHBOR 5**: Should we talk to Claire?  
**NEIGHBOR 6**: Should we call the police?  
**NEIGHBOR 7**: Should we organize  
Some kind of intervention, at least?  

**ALL**: *(hesitating)*
But what if we're wrong?  
What if it's consensual?  
What if we're just  
Being judgmental?  

Better to watch  
Better to wait  
Better to document  
Than to participate  

In something that might  
Be none of our business  
Even though we're all  
Bearing witness  

### **Final Chorus - The Complicity**
*(Building to climax)*

Ring doorbell gossip, motion detected  
Every secret captured and collected  
High-def footage of their private pain  
We're all watching but we share no blame  

For their trauma, for their choices  
We're just echoes, we're just voices  
Commenting on the drama they're creating  
While we're watching, while we're waiting  

For the ending, for the fall  
Ring doorbell gossip sees it all  
But we never intervene  
We just judge them on our screen  

### **Outro - The Realization**
*(Music slowing, becoming more ominous)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: *(quietly)*
When did we become this?  

**NEIGHBOR 2**: 
Watchers instead of neighbors?  

**NEIGHBOR 3**: 
Consumers of other people's pain?  

**NEIGHBOR 4**: 
Voyeurs instead of... saviors?  

**ALL**: *(whispered)*
Motion detected  
Motion detected  
Motion detected  
But no action taken  

No help given  
No hand extended  
Just... watching  
Until it's ended  

*(Final doorbell chime)*

## Director's Notes

This song should make the audience uncomfortable about their own voyeurism. They're watching a musical about people watching their neighbors - the meta-theatrical element should be clear.

The ensemble represents different types of suburban neighbors - the concerned parent, the property-value worrier, the moral panic spreader, the willfully oblivious husband.

The song should build from casual gossip to moral panic to the realization that they're all complicit in enabling the harm by watching instead of helping.

## The Deeper Meaning

"Ring Doorbell Gossip" shows how modern suburban communities have replaced genuine care with digital surveillance. The neighbors are watching everything but helping nothing.

The song reveals the audience's own complicity - we're watching Claire and Jessica's story unfold for entertainment, just like the neighbors. The musical becomes a mirror reflecting our own voyeuristic culture.

The ensemble represents different aspects of American society's response to women's sexual agency - moral panic, economic concern, willful ignorance, and passive consumption.

**This is where the personal becomes political, where private drama becomes public entertainment, and where the community's failure to act becomes its own form of violence.**
