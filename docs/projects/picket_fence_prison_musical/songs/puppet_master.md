## LYRICS

### **Verse 1 - The Setup**
*(David at his computer, multiple screens showing Jessica's profiles)*

She thinks her awakening is organic  
That her desires just suddenly bloomed  
But I've been planting seeds for months now  
In her perfectly curated room  

*(Typing on anonymous account)*

"You seem so authentic, so real  
Have you ever explored your deeper needs?  
There's a whole world of power exchange  
That could fulfill what your soul feeds"  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(Notification sounds, Jessica responding)*

She's so hungry for validation  
So desperate to be seen  
I just give her the permission  
To become what I need her to be  

### **Chorus - The Puppet Master**
*(Building intensity)*

I am the puppet master  
Pulling strings she cannot see  
Every thought she thinks is hers  
Was planted there by me  

Anonymous suggestions  
Become her authentic voice  
She thinks she's making choices  
But I'm controlling every choice  

Pull the string, watch her dance  
Pull the string, watch her fall  
I am the puppet master  
And she's my favorite doll  

### **Verse 2 - The Escalation**
*(Switching between accounts, different personas)*

"Have you considered content creation?  
Your journey could inspire others  
OnlyFans is so empowering  
For sexually liberated mothers"  

*(Another account)*
"I love your authentic exploration  
But maybe push the boundaries more?  
Your followers want to see the real you  
Not just what you've shown before"  

### **Bridge - The Psychology**
*(Music becomes more complex, showing his understanding)*

I studied her adoption trauma  
Her need to prove she's worth the love  
Her competitive nature with other women  
Her fear of never being enough  

*(Building)*
Every message I send her  
Hits exactly where she's weak  
I make her think she's finding herself  
When she's becoming what I seek  

A perfect foil for Claire's journey  
A cautionary tale in real time  
While Claire discovers authentic power  
Jessica commits the perfect crime  

Against her own agency  
Against her own desire  
She's burning herself down  
On my carefully built fire  

### **Verse 3 - The Dangerous Turn**
*(More urgent, the plan escalating)*

"You're so brave, so inspiring  
But have you considered real meetings?  
There are generous admirers  
Who'd pay well for private greetings"  

*(Typing faster)*
"Five thousand for one evening  
With a respectful, wealthy fan  
You deserve to be compensated  
For sharing yourself with a man"  

### **Final Chorus - The Revelation**
*(Full intensity, David's complete control revealed)*

I am the puppet master  
She never had a choice  
Every word she thinks is hers  
Is just my borrowed voice  

Anonymous suggestions  
Became her life's direction  
She thinks she's being empowered  
But she's just my projection  

Pull the string, watch her dance  
Pull the string, watch her fall  
I am the puppet master  
And I'm controlling it all  

### **Outro - The Satisfaction**
*(Music fading, David satisfied)*

*(Spoken, to himself)*
Claire thinks she's special  
Because her journey is private  
But Jessica's public performance  
Makes Claire's submission feel... authentic  

*(Sung, quietly)*
Two women, two paths  
Both leading to me  
One thinks she's chosen  
One thinks she's free  

But I'm the puppet master  
And they're both my design  
Claire's authentic awakening  
And Jessica's decline  

*(Final notification sound)*

## Director's Notes

This song reveals David as a true manipulator, not just a dominant. The audience must understand that Jessica's "awakening" has been manufactured from the beginning.

The staging should feel voyeuristic and uncomfortable - the audience is watching David watch Jessica, making them complicit in the surveillance.

The song should generate both fascination with David's psychological skill and horror at his manipulation of a vulnerable woman.

## Cultural Commentary

- How anonymous accounts can influence real behavior
- The psychology of online grooming and manipulation
- Social media's role in shaping identity and desire

### **Influencer Vulnerability**
- How the need for validation makes people susceptible to manipulation
- The blurred lines between authentic content and performance
- Economic pressures that drive risky online behavior

### **Surveillance Capitalism**
- How personal data and psychology are weaponized
- The commodification of authentic experience
- Technology's role in enabling predatory behavior

## The Deeper Meaning

"Puppet Master" shows how David's control extends far beyond physical dominance into psychological manipulation. He's not just a Dom - he's a predator who uses his understanding of psychology to manufacture the very desires he then claims to fulfill.

The song reveals that Jessica never had agency in her "awakening" - every step was orchestrated by David to serve his larger game with Claire. Her public performance of sexuality wasn't empowerment but manipulation.

This makes Claire's journey more complex - is her "authentic" awakening also manufactured? How much of what she thinks is choice is actually David's influence?

**This is where the musical becomes truly dark - showing how predators use psychology and technology to manufacture consent and desire, making their victims complicit in their own exploitation.**
