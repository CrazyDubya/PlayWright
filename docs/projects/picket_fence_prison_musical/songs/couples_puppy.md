## LYRICS

### **Opening - David's Command**
*(Jessica sits on the floor, David and Claire on furniture)*

**DAVID**: *(cold, controlled)*
Since you can't be trusted to make good choices  
Since you nearly got yourself killed tonight  
You'll stay here where I can watch you  
Until you learn wrong from right  

You wanted to be owned, Jessica  
You wanted to surrender control  
Well, congratulations, you got your wish  
Now you'll play a different role  

### **Verse 1 - Jessica's Compliance**
*(Jessica, voice small and broken)*

Yes, Sir, I understand  
I was bad, I was wrong  
I put myself in danger  
I didn't stay strong  

*(Looking at Claire)*
I'm sorry I ruined your evening  
I'm sorry I took him away  
I'm sorry I'm broken and needy  
I'm sorry I can't just obey  

The rules that normal people follow  
The boundaries that keep them safe  
I'm sorry I'm hollow  
I'm sorry I'm a disgrace  

### **Pre-Chorus - The Degradation**
**DAVID**: 
Good girls don't sell their bodies online  
Good girls don't meet with strangers  
Good girls know where to draw the line  
Good girls avoid the dangers  

You're not a good girl, are you Jessica?  

**JESSICA**: *(whispered)*
No, Sir  

**DAVID**: 
What are you?  

**JESSICA**: *(barely audible)*
I'm your puppy  

### **Chorus - The Humiliation**
*(Jessica on hands and knees)*

**JESSICA**: 
I'm just a puppy, I don't get to choose  
Puppies can't make decisions, they only lose  
When they try to think for themselves  
When they get ideas above their shelves  

I'm just a puppy, I eat from a bowl  
I sleep on the floor, I don't have a soul  
Of my own, of my own  
I'm just a bone  
For you to throw  

### **Verse 2 - Claire's Growing Discomfort**
*(Claire watching, increasingly disturbed)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to David, quietly)*
This feels wrong  

**DAVID**: *(not looking at her)*
She needs structure  
She needs to learn  

**CLAIRE**: 
This isn't structure, this is...  

**DAVID**: 
This is what she asked for  
This is what she earned  

**CLAIRE**: *(standing)*
No one earns this  
No one deserves to be—  

**DAVID**: *(sharp)*
Sit down, Claire  

**CLAIRE**: *(shocked)*
Excuse me?  

**DAVID**: 
I said sit down  
Unless you want to join her  
On the ground  

### **Bridge - Jessica's Desperation**
*(Jessica looking between them)*

**JESSICA**: 
Please don't fight because of me  
Please don't let me ruin this too  
I'll be good, I'll be quiet  
I'll do whatever you want me to do  

I'll be your puppy, I'll be your pet  
I'll be whatever you need  
Just don't abandon me, don't forget  
That I'm here and I bleed  

Just like you, just like her  
I'm human underneath  
But if being human hurts this much  
Maybe I'd rather be beneath  

Your notice, your care, your concern  
Maybe I'd rather be a thing  
That doesn't have to learn  
How to be a human being  

### **Claire's Realization**
**CLAIRE**: *(horrified)*
Jessica, look at me  
Look at me!  

*(Jessica looks up)*

You are not a puppy  
You are not a pet  
You are a woman who made a mistake  
But you're still a woman yet  

**DAVID**: *(warning)*
Claire...  

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
And you... what are you doing?  
What is this supposed to teach?  
That women who make bad choices  
Deserve to be put beyond reach  

Of their own humanity?  
That submission means degradation?  
That love requires the complete  
Destruction of someone's foundation?  

### **Final Chorus - The Breaking Point**
**JESSICA**: *(desperate)*
I'm just a puppy, I don't deserve love  
I'm just a puppy, I'm not good enough  
To be treated like a person  
To be treated like I'm real  

I'm just a puppy, and puppies don't feel  
The way that humans do  
So use me, abuse me  
I'm nothing new  

**CLAIRE**: *(overlapping, to David)*
This isn't dominance, this is cruelty  
This isn't love, this is control  
This isn't helping her, this is  
Destroying her soul  

**DAVID**: *(overlapping, defensive)*
She needs to learn consequences  
She needs to understand  
That actions have reactions  
That she can't just demand  

Respect and safety and care  
When she throws it all away  
For money and attention  
She has to pay  

### **Outro - The Silence**
*(Music stops abruptly)*

**CLAIRE**: *(quietly)*
Get up, Jessica.  

**JESSICA**: *(confused)*
But he said—  

**CLAIRE**: 
I don't care what he said.  
Get up.  

*(Jessica slowly stands)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
We need to talk.  

*(Lights fade)*

## Performance Notes

### **Extreme Content Warning**
This song contains explicit degradation and humiliation that may be triggering for audiences. It must be performed with extreme care and clear artistic purpose.

### **Acting Requirements**
- **Jessica**: Must convey broken humanity without losing audience sympathy
- **David**: Must show both care and cruelty without becoming cartoonish villain
- **Claire**: Must show growing horror and moral awakening
- **All**: Must navigate complex power dynamics authentically

### **Staging Considerations**
- **Safety**: All physical positioning must be safe and consensual for actors
- **Dignity**: Even in degradation, Jessica's humanity must be preserved
- **Audience**: Must be uncomfortable but not traumatized
- **Purpose**: Every moment must serve the story's moral complexity

## Director's Notes

This is the most challenging song in the musical. It must show:
1. How power can become abuse
2. How trauma can make people accept degradation
3. How love can be confused with control
4. How witnesses become complicit

The audience should be deeply uncomfortable but understand that this is a critique of these dynamics, not a celebration of them. Jessica's degradation should feel tragic, not erotic.

Claire's moral awakening is crucial - she must represent the audience's growing horror and the possibility of resistance.

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

### **BDSM Community Consultation**
- Work with actual BDSM educators to show the difference between consensual play and abuse
- Ensure the degradation is clearly framed as problematic, not aspirational
- Show how trauma can make people accept harmful treatment

### **Trauma-Informed Approach**
- Consult with trauma specialists about realistic portrayal
- Provide resources for audience members who may be triggered
- Ensure the song serves a clear moral purpose

**This song exists to show how far things have gone wrong, not to titillate. It's the darkest moment before the characters must choose who they want to be.**
