## LYRICS

### **Verse 1**
I was empty and I was awakening  
I was trapped and I was free  
I was manipulated and I was choosing  
Both are true, both are me  

He orchestrated and he loved me  
He controlled and he set me free  
I was his project and his partner  
Both are true, both are me  

### **Pre-Chorus**
I could spend my life untangling  
What was real and what was planned  
Or I could live inside the mystery  
Of what I don't understand  

### **Chorus**
Both are true, both are true  
I can't choose between the two  
I was lost and I was found  
I was lifted, I was bound  
I was used and I was treasured  
I was broken and I was measured  
For a love I'd never known  
Both are true, I'm not alone  
In this contradiction  

### **Verse 2**
I'm a feminist and I submit  
I'm empowered and I kneel  
I'm a mother and I'm a lover  
Both are true, both are real  

My daughters would be horrified  
And my daughters would understand  
That their mother is a woman  
With desires she can't command  

### **Bridge**
*(Building intensity)*
The world wants simple stories  
Good and bad, right and wrong  
But I'm living in the spaces  
Where the contradictions belong  

I don't need to choose a side  
I don't need to pick a lane  
I can be both saint and sinner  
I can be both joy and pain  

I can love my absent husband  
And I can love my present Dom  
I can be both Claire and slave  
I can be both daughter and mom  

### **Final Chorus**
Both are true, both are true  
And I'm done choosing between the two  
I was lost and I was found  
I was lifted, I was bound  
I was used and I was treasured  
I was broken and I was measured  
For a love I'd never known  
Both are true, and I have grown  
Into this contradiction  

### **Outro**
*(Soft, resolved in her acceptance)*
I am not a simple story  
I am not a moral tale  
I am Claire, I am complex  
I am human, I will not fail  
To be everything I am  
Even when it doesn't make sense  
Both are true  
Both are true  
And that's my transcendence
