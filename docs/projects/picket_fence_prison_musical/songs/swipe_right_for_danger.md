## LYRICS

### **Verse 1**
*(Jessica at her computer, multiple dating apps open)*

Started with content, just for the views  
"Suburban wife explores, what's she got to lose?"  
But comments keep asking, "Is this really real?"  
"Show us more, make us feel"  

*(She opens Tinder, then Bumble, then more apps)*

So I made a profile, just to see  
What strangers might want to do to me  
"Married but curious, looking to play"  
Fifty matches in the first day  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(Swiping frantically)*

Swipe left, swipe right  
Every face a new delight  
Every message makes me high  
Every "hey" makes me fly  

### **Chorus**
*(Building energy, addictive rhythm)*

Swipe right for danger, swipe right for thrills  
Every stranger gives me chills  
They don't know me, I don't know them  
But they want me again and again  

Swipe right for power, swipe right for more  
Every match makes me soar  
Higher than my husband's touch  
This attention means so much  

### **Verse 2**
*(Getting bolder, more apps, more explicit)*

OnlyFans says I could make some cash  
"Suburban MILF, premium stash"  
Custom videos, private chats  
"Tell me your fantasies, I'll do that"  

*(Phone buzzing constantly)*

Ashley Madison, Seeking Arrangement  
Every app a new engagement  
"Meet me tonight, hotel room"  
My heart goes boom, boom, boom  

### **Pre-Chorus**
*(More frantic)*

Swipe left, swipe right  
Strangers in the dead of night  
Every message makes me wet  
Haven't felt this alive yet  

### **Chorus**
*(More desperate, addictive)*

Swipe right for danger, swipe right for thrills  
Every stranger gives me chills  
They don't know me, I don't know them  
But they want me again and again  

Swipe right for power, swipe right for more  
Every match makes me soar  
Higher than my husband's touch  
This attention means so much  

### **Bridge - The First Meeting**
*(Music drops, intimate and dangerous)*

*(Spoken, breathless)*
"Room 237, Marriott downtown  
Don't bring your phone, don't make a sound  
I'll be waiting, door unlocked  
Your safe word is 'stop the clock'"  

*(Sung, building)*
This is really happening  
Not just content, not just a thing  
I'm really going to meet this man  
Who doesn't know my master plan  

*(Voice becoming uncertain)*
Wait... what is my plan?  
What am I doing? I don't understand  
How I got from making content  
To this moment, so potent  

### **Verse 3 - The Realization**
*(Frantic, losing control)*

Seventeen apps, a hundred matches  
My real life barely catches  
Up to my digital desires  
I'm playing with real fires  

Robert's sleeping next to me  
While I plan my infidelity  
Not for love, not for connection  
Just for digital affection  

### **Final Chorus - Desperate**
*(Music chaotic, Jessica losing control)*

Swipe right for danger, I can't stop  
Every match makes my heart drop  
Into a place I don't recognize  
Behind these stranger's eyes  

Swipe right for power, but I'm weak  
Every thrill that I seek  
Takes me further from myself  
I'm just content on a shelf  

### **Outro - The Point of No Return**
*(Music fading to single electronic beat)*

*(Whispered)*
"I'm here. Room 237."  
*(Text sent)*

*(Sung, small and scared)*
What have I done?  
What have I become?  
This isn't content anymore  
This is real, and I'm not sure  

*(Final beat)*
If I remember who I was  
Before the swipes, before the buzz  
Of strangers wanting me  
For things I used to be  

*(Phone notification sound, then silence)*

## Director's Notes

This song shows the dark side of Jessica's journey - how performing sexuality for validation leads to actual dangerous behavior. It's crucial that the audience understands this isn't slut-shaming but rather showing the real consequences of commodifying intimacy.

The progression should feel inevitable - each step seems logical but leads to a dangerous place. Jessica isn't evil, she's addicted to validation and has lost sight of the difference between performance and reality.

The ending should leave the audience genuinely worried for her safety, setting up the consequences that follow.

## The Deeper Meaning

"Swipe Right for Danger" is about the modern epidemic of validation addiction and how social media has commodified intimacy. Jessica's journey shows how the need to be seen and desired can lead to genuinely dangerous situations.

The song critiques not female sexuality but the systems that exploit it - the apps, the algorithms, the culture that tells women their worth comes from being desired by strangers.

It sets up Jessica's eventual consequences while showing that her choices, while dangerous, come from a very human need for connection and validation that our digital culture has twisted into something harmful.

**This is where Jessica crosses the line from performance to real danger, setting up everything that follows.**
