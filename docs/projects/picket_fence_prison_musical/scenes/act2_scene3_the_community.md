## **SCENE 3 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Surveillance Network**
*(Lights up on multiple levels showing different houses. Neighbors appear at windows, doorways, checking Ring doorbells on their phones. Everyone is watching, no one is helping.)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: *(checking Ring doorbell app)*
Did you see the motion alert from last night? Three cars at the Sterling house.

**NEIGHBOR 2**: *(peering through curtains)*
I saw Claire Morrison leaving there this morning. Looking... different.

**NEIGHBOR 3**: *(on phone)*
And Jessica Hartwell's been posting some very interesting content lately.

*(ROSA enters, moving between houses with cleaning supplies)*

**ROSA**: *(to audience)*
Another day in paradise. Rich people watching rich people while pretending they're not watching.

### **SONG: "RING DOORBELL GOSSIP" (Ensemble)**

### **Opening - The Notifications**
*(Sound of multiple doorbell notifications, neighbors checking phones)*

**ENSEMBLE**: *(overlapping, creating rhythm)*
Motion detected, 2:47 AM  
Someone leaving David Sterling's again  
Is that Claire? Is that Jessica?  
Both of them? What's happening here?  

**NEIGHBOR 1**: Did you see what happened at the Morrison's?  
**NEIGHBOR 2**: Ring doorbell caught it all  
**NEIGHBOR 3**: I've got the footage saved  
**NEIGHBOR 4**: Should we call?  
**ALL**: Nah, let's just watch and see what happens next  

### **Verse 1 - The Watching**
**WOMEN**: 
Motion detected, every night  
Someone's car in David's drive  
Is that Claire? Is that Jessica?  
How do they both survive  
This scandal in our neighborhood?  

**MEN**: 
*(Still on phones/games, but listening)*
Whatever, babe, just keep it down  
I'm checking Jessica's account  
As long as it doesn't affect  
Our property values, I don't count  
The cost of their choices  

### **Pre-Chorus - The Justification**
**ALL**: 
We're not being nosy  
We're just being aware  
Community safety  
Means we have to care  
About what's happening  
In our neighborhood  
We're just looking out  
Like good neighbors should  

### **Chorus - Ring Doorbell Gossip**
**ENSEMBLE**: *(rapid-fire)*
Ring doorbell gossip, motion detected  
Every secret captured and collected  
High-def footage of their private shame  
We're all watching but we're not to blame  

For their choices, for their actions  
We're just passive, just reactions  
To the drama that they're creating  
While we're watching, while we're waiting  

For the climax, for the fall  
Ring doorbell gossip sees it all  
But we never intervene  
We just watch the drama on our screen  

### **Verse 2 - The Escalation**
**NEIGHBOR 5**: Did you see Jessica's OnlyFans?  
**NEIGHBOR 6**: My husband found the link  
**NEIGHBOR 7**: She's making bank off this scandal  
**NEIGHBOR 8**: What will people think?  

**NEIGHBOR 1**: About our neighborhood?  
**NEIGHBOR 2**: About our property values?  
**NEIGHBOR 3**: About our children?  
**NEIGHBOR 4**: About our family values?  

### **Rosa's Interlude**
*(ROSA stops cleaning, addresses the audience)*

**ROSA**: 
You want to know the truth about this neighborhood? Everyone's a customer. Everyone's watching. Everyone's paying.

*(She pulls out her phone)*

Neighbor 1? Subscribed to Jessica's premium content.  
Neighbor 2? Downloaded the Ring doorbell footage.  
Neighbor 3? Shared the videos in the group chat.  

They're all funding what they're judging.

### **Bridge - The Moral Panic**
**WOMEN**: 
What if our daughters see this?  
What if they think it's normal?  
What if they start to believe  
That this behavior is formal  
Acceptable, even empowering?  
What message does this send?  

**MEN**: 
*(Looking up from phones)*
Wait, what's happening?  
Can someone explain?  
I wasn't really listening  
Can you start again?  

*(They go back to their phones, where they're watching Jessica's content)*

### **Verse 3 - The Intervention That Never Comes**
**NEIGHBOR 5**: Should we talk to Claire?  
**NEIGHBOR 6**: Should we call the police?  
**NEIGHBOR 7**: Should we organize  
Some kind of intervention, at least?  

**ALL**: *(hesitating)*
But what if we're wrong?  
What if it's consensual?  
What if we're just  
Being judgmental?  

Better to watch  
Better to wait  
Better to document  
Than to participate  

In something that might  
Be none of our business  
Even though we're all  
Bearing witness  

### **The Revelation - They're All Customers**
*(ROSA reveals the truth)*

**ROSA**: *(speaking over the music)*
You want to know why no one intervenes? Because they're all customers.

*(She points to each neighbor)*

You - Jessica's top subscriber.  
You - bought her custom content.  
You - shared her videos in the neighborhood chat.  
You - downloaded Claire's Ring doorbell footage.  

You're not concerned citizens. You're consumers.

### **Final Chorus - The Complicity**
**ENSEMBLE**: *(building to climax)*
Ring doorbell gossip, motion detected  
Every secret captured and collected  
High-def footage of their private pain  
We're all watching but we share no blame  

For their trauma, for their choices  
We're just echoes, we're just voices  
Commenting on the drama they're creating  
While we're watching, while we're waiting  

For the ending, for the fall  
Ring doorbell gossip sees it all  
But we never intervene  
We just judge them on our screen  

### **Outro - The Realization**
*(Music slowing, becoming more ominous)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: *(quietly)*
When did we become this?  

**NEIGHBOR 2**: 
Watchers instead of neighbors?  

**NEIGHBOR 3**: 
Consumers of other people's pain?  

**NEIGHBOR 4**: 
Voyeurs instead of... saviors?  

**ROSA**: *(final word)*
You became this the moment you chose entertainment over empathy.

**ALL**: *(whispered)*
Motion detected  
Motion detected  
Motion detected  
But no action taken  

No help given  
No hand extended  
Just... watching  
Until it's ended  

*(Final doorbell chime as lights fade)*
