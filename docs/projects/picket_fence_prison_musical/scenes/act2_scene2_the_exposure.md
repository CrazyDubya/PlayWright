## **SCENE 2 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Secret Life**
*(Lights up on Michael's home office. Multiple monitors show Jessica's OnlyFans content, financial spreadsheets, and gaming interfaces. MICHAEL sits surrounded by tissues, energy drinks, and credit card statements. He's reviewing Jessica's latest content.)*

**MICHAEL**: *(to himself, scrolling)*
"Day seventeen of my awakening journey..." God, she's so honest about her feelings. So real about what she wants.

*(He clicks on a premium video)*

Fifty dollars for custom content. Worth every penny.

*(He types a message)*

"You looked incredible last night at the party. Would love to see more of your 'authentic exploration.'"

*(CLAIRE enters the kitchen, visible through the doorway. She moves differently - confident, aware of her body. MICHAEL doesn't notice.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(calling out)*
Michael, I'm going out for a few hours.

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up)*
Mm-hmm. Sure, babe.

**CLAIRE**: *(testing)*
I'm meeting David Sterling for dinner.

**MICHAEL**: *(still scrolling)*
Sounds good.

**CLAIRE**: *(realizing)*
You're not even listening.

**MICHAEL**: *(automatic response)*
Of course I'm listening. Have fun.

*(CLAIRE stares at him for a moment, then shakes her head and exits)*

### **SONG: "CUSTOMER #247"**
*(Michael's pathetic confession)*

**MICHAEL**: *(starting defensively)*
I'm not a bad guy, I'm just a man  
With needs that my wife doesn't understand  
She's always tired, always stressed  
Always something, never undressed  

*(Clicking through Jessica's content)*

So I found a little outlet  
A harmless way to cope  
Just some videos, some pictures  
Nothing more than digital hope  

That somewhere there's a woman  
Who actually wants to please  
Who doesn't make me beg for attention  
Who gets down on her knees  

*(Building defensiveness)*

It's not cheating if it's pixels  
It's not wrong if no one knows  
It's just entertainment, just a service  
That's how the internet goes  

I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
On a website selling heaven  
To suburban guys like me  
Who pay for what we'll never see  

At home, in our own beds  
With our wives who've given up  
I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
Drinking from a poisoned cup  

*(Getting more involved, typing requests)*

Started with the basic subscription  
Twenty bucks a month, no big deal  
Then the custom videos started  
Making everything feel more real  

"Say my name, wear this outfit  
Pretend that you're my neighbor  
Do the things my wife won't do  
Be my digital savior"  

Fifty here, a hundred there  
For personalized attention  
She knows exactly what I want  
Without me having to mention  

That I'm married, that I'm lonely  
That I live right down the street  
That I watch her every morning  
When she gets her mail in heat  

*(Music becoming more frantic as realization sets in)*

Wait... is that Claire in the background?  
Wait... is that David's voice?  
Wait... is my wife involved  
In Jessica's sexual choice?  

Oh God, what if she finds out?  
What if the neighbors know?  
What if my credit card statements  
Reveal where my money goes?  

*(Final verse, complete breakdown)*

I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
But I'm going straight to hell  
For paying for my neighbor's body  
While my marriage goes to hell  

I'm a hypocrite, I'm a coward  
I'm everything that's wrong  
With suburban male entitlement  
I've been singing the wrong song  

About family values, about morality  
While I pay for digital sin  
I'm just customer number two-four-seven  
And the shame is caving in  

### **Rosa's Entrance**
*(ROSA enters with cleaning supplies, immediately noticing the screens)*

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
Buenos días, Señor Michael.

**MICHAEL**: *(frantically closing windows)*
Rosa! I... I was just... working.

**ROSA**: *(not looking at the screens)*
Sí, I can see. Very hard work.

*(She starts cleaning around him)*

**MICHAEL**: *(defensive)*
It's not what it looks like.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
It looks like a man paying to watch his neighbor take her clothes off while his wife transforms into a different woman in the next room.

**MICHAEL**: *(shocked)*
You... you know about...?

**ROSA**: 
Señor Michael, I clean houses. I see everything. Your credit card statements on the desk, your wife's new confidence, your neighbor's new... business venture.

**MICHAEL**: *(panicked)*
You can't tell anyone. Please, Rosa. My reputation, my job...

**ROSA**: *(continuing to clean)*
Your reputation? Señor, you pay money to watch a woman degrade herself while your own wife starves for attention. What reputation?

### **The Confrontation**

**MICHAEL**: *(desperate)*
You don't understand. Claire and I... we've grown apart. We don't connect anymore.

**ROSA**: *(pausing her cleaning)*
When was the last time you tried to connect with her?

**MICHAEL**: 
I... we... it's complicated.

**ROSA**: 
When was the last time you asked her how she was feeling? Really asked, not just "how was your day?"

**MICHAEL**: *(long pause)*
I... I don't remember.

**ROSA**: 
When was the last time you touched her? Not for sex, just... touched her?

**MICHAEL**: *(longer pause)*
I...

**ROSA**: 
But you know exactly when Jessica posted her last video, no?

**MICHAEL**: *(ashamed)*
That's different.

**ROSA**: 
Sí, it is different. Jessica performs for money. Your wife lives for love. And you choose the performance.

### **The Revelation**

**MICHAEL**: *(breaking down)*
I don't know how to talk to Claire anymore. Every time I try, I say the wrong thing. Every time I reach for her, she's already being strong for someone else.

**ROSA**: *(softening slightly)*
So you stopped trying?

**MICHAEL**: 
It was easier. Jessica... Jessica doesn't expect anything from me except money. She doesn't need me to be strong or supportive or... present.

**ROSA**: 
And your wife?

**MICHAEL**: 
My wife deserves better than what I can give her.

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
So you give her nothing instead?

**MICHAEL**: *(realizing)*
I give her nothing instead.

*(He looks at his screens, then at his credit card statements)*

God, what have I become?

**ROSA**: 
You became a customer, Señor Michael. The question is - do you want to become a husband again?

### **The Choice**

**MICHAEL**: *(looking at Jessica's content)*
She's so beautiful. So open about what she wants.

**ROSA**: 
She's performing, Señor. Your wife is living.

**MICHAEL**: 
But Claire doesn't... she doesn't want...

**ROSA**: *(interrupting)*
How do you know what she wants? When did you last ask?

*(She finishes cleaning and packs her supplies)*

Your wife left this morning looking like a woman who remembered she has a body. Your neighbor is selling pictures of hers online. One is discovering herself, one is selling herself.

*(She heads for the door)*

Choose wisely, Señor Michael. Some things, once lost, don't come back.

### **Final Moment**
*(MICHAEL sits alone with his screens)*

**MICHAEL**: *(to himself)*
Customer number two-four-seven.

*(He looks at a photo of Claire on his desk - their wedding photo)*

When did I stop seeing you, Claire? When did I start preferring the performance to the real thing?

*(He closes his laptop)*

What have I done?

*(Lights fade as he stares at the wedding photo)*

## **Scene Analysis**

### **What This Scene Accomplishes**
1. **Michael's pathetic voyeurism** - Revealed as Jessica's paying customer
2. **Complete obliviousness** - Misses Claire's transformation happening in front of him
3. **Suburban male hypocrisy** - Judges publicly while consuming privately
4. **Rosa's reality check** - Calls out his choices and their consequences
5. **Setup for his downfall** - Credit card evidence, growing shame

### **Character Development**
- **Michael**: Revealed as pathetic rather than absent - actively choosing performance over reality
- **Rosa**: Provides moral clarity without judgment - shows the difference between performing and living
- **Claire** (brief appearance): Her transformation is visible but unnoticed by Michael

### **The Hypocrisy Exposed**
- **Pays for Jessica's content** while ignoring Claire's needs
- **Prefers performed sexuality** to authentic intimacy
- **Chooses digital connection** over real relationship
- **Economic enabler** of the system he would publicly condemn

### **Rosa's Wisdom**
- **"Jessica performs for money. Your wife lives for love. And you choose the performance."**
- **"Some things, once lost, don't come back."**
- **Shows Michael his choices without excusing them**

### **Setup for Act II Continuation**
- **Michael's growing awareness** of what he's lost
- **Credit card evidence** that could expose him
- **Claire's continued transformation** that he's missing
- **The question**: Will he try to reconnect or continue hiding?

**This scene shows Michael as the suburban everyman who's chosen digital fantasy over real intimacy, setting up his eventual reckoning with the consequences of emotional absence.**
