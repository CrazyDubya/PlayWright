## **SCENE 3 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Perfect Suburban Gathering**
*(Lights up on the cul-de-sac. String lights, perfectly arranged food tables, neighbors mingling with wine glasses. Everyone is performing their best suburban selves.)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: The property values in this area just keep climbing!

**NEIGHBOR 2**: Did you see the Hendersons put in that new pool? Must have cost a fortune.

**NEIGHBOR 3**: Well, they can afford it. His tech company went public last year.

*(ROSA moves through serving drinks, invisible to the guests)*

**ROSA**: *(to audience, while serving)*
Another night in paradise. Rich people pretending to enjoy each other's company while checking their phones every thirty seconds.

*(CLAIRE approaches with a wine glass, clearly not her first)*

**CLAIRE**: Rosa, thank you so much for helping tonight. You didn't have to stay late.

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
You pay me overtime, Señora. I stay.

**CLAIRE**: *(slightly slurred)*
You know what, Rosa? You're the only honest person here.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
That's because I can't afford to lie. Lies are a luxury.

### **SONG: "DIGITAL GHOSTS" (Male Ensemble)**
*(The husbands, all on their phones/devices)*

**MICHAEL**: *(scrolling, not looking up)*
Another notification, another ping  
Another dopamine hit from this digital thing  
She's talking but I'm scrolling  
Through a life that isn't real  

**ROBERT**: *(gaming on phone)*
Forty-seven kills, my ranking's going up  
While my marriage slowly empties like a broken cup  
She used to try to talk to me  
Now she doesn't even try  

**MALE ENSEMBLE**: *(robotic movements, staring at screens)*
We are the digital ghosts  
Haunting our own homes  
Present but not here  
Connected but alone  
We're all logged in  
But no one's really home  

*(During the song, MICHAEL secretly starts filming JESSICA with his phone)*

### **David's Entrance**
*(DAVID arrives fashionably late, immediately commanding attention without trying)*

**NEIGHBOR 1**: Oh, that's the new neighbor. David something...

**NEIGHBOR 2**: Sterling. Moved in three months ago. Very private.

**NEIGHBOR 3**: I heard he's some kind of consultant. Works from home.

*(JESSICA immediately perks up, smoothing her dress)*

**JESSICA**: *(to Robert, who doesn't look up from his phone)*
Honey, should we go introduce ourselves?

**ROBERT**: *(still gaming)*
Mm-hmm. Sure. In a minute.

*(JESSICA approaches DAVID alone)*

**JESSICA**: Hi! I'm Jessica Hartwell. We live across the street.

**DAVID**: *(polite but distant)*
David Sterling. Nice to meet you.

**JESSICA**: *(flirtatious)*
I've been meaning to come by with a welcome basket. Maybe we could... get to know each other better?

**DAVID**: *(studying her)*
I'm sure we will, Jessica. In time.

*(His attention shifts to CLAIRE, who's laughing too loudly at someone's joke)*

**DAVID**: *(to Jessica, but watching Claire)*
Excuse me.

*(He moves toward CLAIRE. JESSICA watches, alarmed)*

### **The Approach**
*(DAVID approaches CLAIRE, who's clearly had too much wine)*

**CLAIRE**: *(turning, slightly unsteady)*
Oh! The mysterious neighbor. David, right?

**DAVID**: 
Claire. You look like you're enjoying yourself.

**CLAIRE**: *(laughing)*
Enjoying myself? That's one way to put it. I'm performing enjoyment. There's a difference.

**DAVID**: *(intrigued)*
And what would actual enjoyment look like?

**CLAIRE**: *(wine making her bold)*
I have no idea. I forgot how to want things for myself about twenty years ago.

**DAVID**: *(stepping closer)*
That's a shame. A woman like you should know exactly what she wants.

**CLAIRE**: *(feeling the charge between them)*
A woman like me? What kind of woman is that?

**DAVID**: 
The kind who's been holding her breath so long she's forgotten how to exhale.

*(CLAIRE stares at him, caught)*

### **SONG: "NO PANTIES TOMORROW" (Claire & David Duet)**
*(The seduction that changes everything)*

**CLAIRE**: *(flirtatious but nervous)*
I used to dance like no one was watching  
Before I learned that everyone was  
I used to laugh without calculating  
The social cost of everything I does  

*(She moves closer, emboldened by wine)*

But tonight the wine is talking  
And it's saying things I shouldn't say  
Like how I notice when you're walking  
And how you make me feel a certain way  

**DAVID**: *(studying her, voice controlled but warm)*
I've been watching you for months now  
Behind your perfect suburban mask  
There's a woman who's forgotten how  
To take what she wants, to even ask  

*(He steps closer, voice dropping)*

You move through life like you're apologizing  
For taking up space, for having needs  
But I can see through your disguising  
The fire that your careful life conceals  

**BOTH**: *(Building tension, circling each other)*
**CLAIRE**: There's something dangerous in your eyes  
**DAVID**: There's something hungry in your soul  
**CLAIRE**: Something that terrifies  
**DAVID**: Something that could make you whole  
**BOTH**: If you're brave enough to let it  

**DAVID**: *(Voice becoming more commanding)*
Dance with me like no one's watching  
Even though they are  
Show me the woman you're hiding  
Behind your suburban star  

Let me see you move your body  
Like you used to move your mind  
Before you learned that being sorry  
Was the only way to shine  

*(CLAIRE dances closer, more sensually)*

**CLAIRE**: *(Getting bolder)*
I haven't felt this alive in years  
This reckless, this awake  
All my careful constructed fears  
Are starting to break  

You make me want to do things  
I've never even dreamed  
You make me want to sing  
Like I'm bursting at the seams  

### **The Command**
*(Music drops to almost nothing, intimate conversation)*

**DAVID**: *(low, close to her ear)*
Tell me what you want, Claire  

**CLAIRE**: *(breathless)*
I... I don't know how to want things anymore  

**DAVID**: *(gentle but firm)*
Then let me teach you  
Let me show you how to feel again  

**CLAIRE**: *(whispered)*
What would that look like?  

**DAVID**: *(building, music starting to return)*
It starts with trust  
It starts with surrender  
It starts with doing something  
You'll remember  

*(Music builds, his voice becoming commanding)*

No panties tomorrow when you go to the store  
Let every step remind you of what you're living for  
Feel the fabric of your dress against your skin  
And remember this is where your real life begins  

**CLAIRE**: *(shocked, aroused, conflicted)*
I can't... I'm not... that's not who I am  
I'm a mother, I'm a wife  
I can't just change the plan  
I've built my entire life  

**DAVID**: *(following, voice gentle but insistent)*
That's exactly who you are, Claire  
You just forgot how to let her breathe  
The woman who danced without a care  
Is still there underneath  

### **The Witnesses**
*(During the song, we see the reactions of others)*

**JESSICA**: *(watching, devastated)*
He's never looked at me like that  
He's never spoken to me like that  
Three months of content, three months of submission  
And she gets his attention in one conversation  

**MICHAEL**: *(filming Jessica's reaction)*
This is better than any porn  
My neighbor's wife falling apart  
While my own wife dances with a stranger  
And I'm recording it all  

**ROSA**: *(serving drinks, to audience)*
And here we go. Rich people discovering they have feelings.  
This always ends well.

**NEIGHBORS**: *(pretending not to watch while watching everything)*
Did you see that?  
Are they...?  
Should someone...?  
This is better than Netflix  

### **The Choice**
*(Final chorus building to climax)*

**DAVID**: No panties tomorrow, feel alive again  
**CLAIRE**: I'm terrified of what that might begin  
**DAVID**: Feel the power of your own desire  
**CLAIRE**: Feel the danger, feel the fire  
**BOTH**: This is where your real life starts  
**BOTH**: This is where you trust your heart  

**CLAIRE**: *(whispered, almost to herself)*
No panties tomorrow...  

*(Looking at him directly)*
What else?  

**DAVID**: *(smiling)*
That's my girl  

### **The Aftermath**
*(Music ends. The party continues around them, but everything has changed)*

**JESSICA**: *(approaching, voice tight)*
Claire! What a lovely party. And David, so nice to see you again.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered, coming down from the high)*
Jessica! Yes, we were just... David was just telling me about his work.

**JESSICA**: *(to David)*
I'm sure he was. David's very... thorough in his explanations.

**DAVID**: *(to both women)*
Ladies, thank you for a lovely evening. Claire, I look forward to our next conversation.

*(He exits, leaving both women staring after him)*

**MICHAEL**: *(still filming, to himself)*
This is going to get so much better.

### **Rosa's Interlude**
*(ROSA approaches CLAIRE as guests begin to leave)*

**ROSA**: *(collecting glasses)*
Interesting evening, Señora.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
What do you mean?

**ROSA**: 
Nothing. Just... interesting how quickly things can change.  
One conversation, one dance, one... suggestion.

**CLAIRE**: 
Rosa, I don't know what you think you saw...

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
I saw a woman who's been thirsty for twenty years  
Finally offered a drink.  
Just remember, Señora - not all water is safe to drink.

*(She exits with the glasses)*

### **Final Moment**
*(CLAIRE stands alone in her backyard, touching David's business card)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
No panties tomorrow...

*(She looks toward her house where MICHAEL is still on his phone)*

What have I done?

*(She looks toward DAVID's house)*

What am I going to do?

*(Lights fade as she stands between her two worlds)*
