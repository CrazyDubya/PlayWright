## **SCENE 4 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - Two Different Mornings**
*(Lights up on split stage. CLAIRE stands in her kitchen, coffee in hand, wearing a dress but clearly no underwear - her posture is different, more aware of her body. JESSICA sits in her content studio, setting up cameras with manic energy.)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself, touching the fabric of her dress)*
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe how... aware I am of everything. The fabric, the air, the way I'm standing...

**JESSICA**: *(to her camera, but not recording yet)*
Okay, Jessica. You can do this. Turn your pain into content. Turn your jealousy into authenticity. The audience loves drama.

*(MICHAEL enters Claire's kitchen, on his phone as usual)*

**MICHAEL**: *(not looking up)*
Morning, babe. Coffee ready?

**CLAIRE**: *(studying him)*
It's been ready for twenty minutes, Michael. Like every morning for twenty-five years.

**MICHAEL**: *(still not looking up)*
Great, thanks.

*(He pours coffee, still scrolling)*

**CLAIRE**: *(testing)*
I'm thinking of dyeing my hair purple today.

**MICHAEL**: *(automatic)*
Sounds good, babe.

**CLAIRE**: *(realizing)*
You're not even listening.

**MICHAEL**: *(finally looking up)*
What? Sorry, work email. What did you say?

**CLAIRE**: *(sadly)*
Nothing, Michael. Nothing at all.

### **SONG: "WHAT HAVE I DONE?" (Claire's Confusion)**

**CLAIRE**: *(starting quietly, moving through her kitchen)*
What have I done, what have I started?  
One conversation and I'm broken-hearted  
For the woman I used to be  
Before I felt this electricity  

*(She touches her dress, aware of her body)*

Every step reminds me of his words  
Every movement feels absurd  
Like I'm walking through my life  
For the first time as a wife  
Who remembers she's a woman  

What have I done, what have I chosen?  
Twenty-five years of being frozen  
And one stranger's simple command  
Makes me feel like I can stand  
In my own skin, in my own space  
With my own needs, my own grace  

*(Building intensity)*

I should feel guilty, I should feel shame  
But all I feel is alive again  
Like I've been sleeping for decades  
And someone finally pulled the shades  
Let the sunlight hit my face  
Showed me I deserve this place  

What have I done?  
What have I done?  
I think I've finally begun  
To remember who I am  
Underneath this perfect plan  
I've been living for so long  

### **Jessica's Content Creation**

*(JESSICA turns on her camera, immediately switching to performance mode)*

**JESSICA**: *(bright, fake smile)*
Good morning, beautiful souls! It's your girl Jessica, and wow, do I have some tea to spill today about jealousy, competition, and what it really means to be chosen.

*(Her smile falters slightly)*

So last night, I witnessed something that really triggered me. I watched someone else get the attention I thought I deserved, and it brought up all my abandonment issues.

*(She adjusts her position, making sure the lighting is perfect)*

But here's the thing, beautiful souls - jealousy is just love with nowhere to go. And sometimes we have to watch the people we care about explore connections with others.

### **SONG: "CONTENT GOLD" (Jessica's Performance)**

**JESSICA**: *(to her camera, building energy)*
Turn your pain into content gold  
Make your trauma worth being told  
Every tear becomes a view  
Every breakdown something new  
For the audience to consume  

*(Her performance becomes more manic)*

Monetize your misery  
Turn your hurt into currency  
Every heartbreak pays the rent  
Every crisis, money spent  
By strangers who love your pain  

"Day sixteen of my awakening journey  
And today we're talking about jealousy  
How it feels to watch someone else  
Get what you thought belonged to you"  

*(Her voice cracks slightly)*

But I'm not bitter, I'm not broken  
I'm just a woman who's awoken  
To the fact that love is shared  
And sometimes you're not prepared  
For how much sharing hurts  

Content gold, content gold  
Every story can be sold  
If you package it just right  
Make your darkness into light  
That others want to buy  

*(She turns off the camera, and her performance drops)*

God, I sound pathetic. But pathetic pays the bills.

### **Rosa's Entrance**
*(ROSA enters Claire's kitchen with cleaning supplies)*

**ROSA**: *(matter-of-fact)*
Buenos días, Señora Claire.

**CLAIRE**: *(startled)*
Oh! Rosa, good morning. You're early today.

**ROSA**: *(studying Claire)*
Same time as always. But you're... different today.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
Different how?

**ROSA**: *(cleaning, observant)*
You're standing taller. Moving different. Like you remember you have a body.

**CLAIRE**: *(flustered)*
I don't know what you mean.

**ROSA**: *(dry)*
Sí, you do. Question is - what are you going to do about it?

**CLAIRE**: 
About what?

**ROSA**: *(pausing her cleaning)*
About the fact that you're awake now, Señora. And awake people make choices. The question is - what choices are you going to make?

### **Michael's Secret**
*(MICHAEL, still in the kitchen, pulls up Jessica's content on his phone)*

**MICHAEL**: *(to himself, watching Jessica's video)*
"Day sixteen of my awakening journey..." God, she's so authentic. So real about her feelings.

*(He looks at CLAIRE, who's talking to ROSA)*

Why can't my own wife be this open about what she wants?

*(He doesn't notice CLAIRE's transformation happening right in front of him)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to Rosa)*
Rosa, can I ask you something personal?

**ROSA**: 
You pay me to clean, not for therapy. But go ahead.

**CLAIRE**: 
Have you ever felt invisible in your own life?

**ROSA**: *(considering)*
Every day, Señora. But there's a difference between being invisible to others and being invisible to yourself.

**CLAIRE**: 
What do you mean?

**ROSA**: 
You've been invisible to yourself for so long, you forgot you existed. Now someone sees you, and you remember. The question is - what are you going to do with that memory?

### **The Text Message**
*(CLAIRE's phone buzzes. She reads it, and her entire demeanor changes)*

**DAVID**: *(text message)*
"Good girl. I can tell you followed my instruction just by the way you're walking. Meet me at the coffee shop on Main Street at 2 PM. Wear the blue dress."

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
He can tell just by watching me walk?

*(She looks around - MICHAEL is absorbed in his phone, ROSA is cleaning)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to Rosa)*
Rosa, I need to go out this afternoon. Can you stay until 4?

**ROSA**: *(not looking up)*
Sí, Señora. But be careful.

**CLAIRE**: 
Careful of what?

**ROSA**: 
Of forgetting that feeling alive and making good choices are two different things.

### **Jessica's Escalation**
*(JESSICA turns her camera back on)*

**JESSICA**: *(more desperate)*
"Okay, beautiful souls, I'm going to be really vulnerable with you right now. Sometimes awakening means watching someone else get what you want and learning to be happy for them."

*(Her voice becomes strained)*

"But what if you can't be happy for them? What if it just hurts? What if watching them get chosen makes you feel like you're being unchosen?"

*(She starts to cry, then catches herself)*

"Sorry, beautiful souls. This is just... this is hard. But that's what makes it authentic, right? The hard parts are where the growth happens."

*(She turns off the camera)*

Fuck. I'm losing it. I need to do something bigger. Something that will get his attention back.

### **The Collision Course**
*(CLAIRE reads David's text again)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
Two o'clock. Blue dress. He wants to see me again.

*(JESSICA, in her space, types frantically)*

**JESSICA**: *(typing)*
"Sir, I have an idea for content that might interest you. Something public. Something that shows my dedication."

*(Both women are now moving toward the same goal - David's attention - but for completely different reasons)*

### **Rosa's Final Observation**
*(ROSA finishes cleaning and approaches CLAIRE)*

**ROSA**: 
Señora Claire, one more thing.

**CLAIRE**: 
Yes?

**ROSA**: 
That man you danced with last night? He's not your salvation. He's just a mirror. What you see in him is what was already inside you. Don't give him credit for what you're discovering about yourself.

**CLAIRE**: *(defensive)*
I'm not giving him credit for anything.

**ROSA**: *(shrugging)*
If you say so. But remember - mirrors can break. And when they do, you need to know who you are without them.

*(She exits, leaving CLAIRE alone with her phone and her choice)*

### **Final Moment**
*(CLAIRE stands in her kitchen, holding David's text)*

**CLAIRE**: *(to herself)*
Two o'clock. Blue dress.

*(She looks toward MICHAEL, who's still absorbed in his phone)*

Twenty-five years of being invisible to you, Michael. And one day of being seen by him.

*(She looks at the text again)*

I'm going.

*(Lights fade as she heads upstairs to change)*
