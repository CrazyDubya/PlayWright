## **SCENE 6 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Arrival**
*(Lights up on David's living room. Elegant, masculine, with subtle hints of his dominant lifestyle - expensive furniture arranged for conversation and control. DAVID waits, checking his watch.)*

**DAVID**: *(to himself)*
Eight o'clock. Let's see who arrives first. Let's see who wants this more.

*(Doorbell rings. DAVID opens it to reveal CLAIRE, nervous but determined)*

**CLAIRE**: *(hesitant)*
I... I wasn't sure I should come.

**DAVID**: *(stepping aside to let her in)*
But you did. That tells me everything I need to know.

**CLAIRE**: *(looking around)*
Your home is beautiful.

**DAVID**: 
Thank you. Wine?

**CLAIRE**: 
I probably shouldn't. Wine got me into this situation.

**DAVID**: *(pouring two glasses)*
Wine didn't get you into anything, Claire. Wine just gave you permission to want what you already wanted.

*(Doorbell rings again. DAVID smiles)*

**DAVID**: 
And that would be Jessica.

**CLAIRE**: *(realizing)*
You invited us both at the same time?

**DAVID**: 
I did.

**CLAIRE**: 
Why?

**DAVID**: *(opening the door)*
Because I wanted to see what you'd both do.

*(JESSICA enters, dressed more provocatively, clearly having prepared for seduction)*

**JESSICA**: *(bright, performative)*
David! Thank you so much for inviting me. I brought my camera in case you wanted to create some content together...

*(She stops, seeing CLAIRE)*

Oh. Claire. I didn't realize you'd be here too.

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
You didn't tell her either?

**DAVID**: *(closing the door)*
I told you both exactly what you needed to know. Please, sit.

*(Both women sit, but on opposite sides of the room)*

### **The Proposition**

**DAVID**: *(standing between them)*
Ladies, we find ourselves in an interesting situation. You're both here because you want something from me. The question is - what are you willing to give to get it?

**JESSICA**: *(eager)*
Whatever you want, David. I'm completely open to exploring...

**CLAIRE**: *(interrupting)*
Jessica, what are you talking about?

**JESSICA**: *(defensive)*
I'm talking about authentic exploration of power dynamics and...

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
What is this? What's really happening here?

**DAVID**: *(sitting down)*
What's happening, Claire, is that you're both discovering who you really are. Jessica has been exploring submission for months. You discovered it yesterday. The question is - are you ready to explore it together?

**CLAIRE**: *(shocked)*
Together?

**JESSICA**: *(excited)*
Oh my God, yes. David, that's brilliant. We could create amazing content...

**CLAIRE**: *(standing)*
Content? This is about content?

**DAVID**: *(calmly)*
Sit down, Claire.

*(CLAIRE automatically sits, surprising herself)*

**DAVID**: 
For Jessica, this started as content. For you, it started as awakening. But you're both here for the same reason - you want to feel something real.

### **SONG: "BOTH OF YOU" (Act I Finale)**

**DAVID**: *(starting quietly, to both women)*
I've been watching you both for months now  
Jessica performing, Claire hiding somehow  
Behind your perfect suburban masks  
Neither of you knowing how to ask  
For what you really need  

*(Moving between them)*

Jessica, you think submission means performance  
Claire, you think it means surrender  
But you're both missing the importance  
Of what I'm here to render  

**JESSICA**: *(defensive but intrigued)*
I know what submission means  
I've been exploring for months  
Creating authentic content, living dreams  
Of power exchange and wants  

**CLAIRE**: *(confused)*
I don't understand what's happening  
I thought this was about connection  
I thought you saw something in me  
That deserved your attention  

**DAVID**: *(building intensity)*
Both of you, both of you  
Are exactly what I need  
Jessica, your hunger for approval  
Claire, your hunger to be freed  

Both of you, both of you  
Bring something to this dance  
Jessica brings experience  
Claire brings innocence  

### **The Realization**

**CLAIRE**: *(standing again)*
Wait. You've been... with her? This whole time?

**JESSICA**: *(proudly)*
For three months. David's been helping me explore my authentic self.

**CLAIRE**: *(to David)*
So I'm not... special?

**DAVID**: *(approaching her)*
You're both special, Claire. In different ways. Jessica knows how to submit. You know how to surrender. There's a difference.

**CLAIRE**: *(backing away)*
I don't understand the difference.

**DAVID**: 
Submission is a choice you make with your mind. Surrender is something that happens to your soul.

*(He turns to JESSICA)*

Show her, Jessica.

**JESSICA**: *(immediately dropping to her knees)*
Yes, Sir.

*(CLAIRE stares, shocked)*

**DAVID**: *(to Claire)*
Jessica submits because she's learned it gets her what she wants. You surrender because you can't help yourself.

*(He approaches CLAIRE)*

The question is - can you do both?

### **The Choice**

**CLAIRE**: *(torn)*
I... I don't know if I can do this. With her here. With an audience.

**JESSICA**: *(from the floor)*
Claire, this could be beautiful. We could explore together. We could support each other's journeys...

**CLAIRE**: *(to Jessica)*
Is that what this is for you? A journey? Content?

**JESSICA**: *(honest for the first time)*
It started that way. But David... David makes me feel chosen. Even if I have to share him.

**DAVID**: *(to Claire)*
The choice is yours, Claire. You can leave right now and go back to your safe, empty life. Or you can stay and discover what it means to be truly alive.

**CLAIRE**: *(long pause)*
If I stay... what happens?

**DAVID**: 
You learn. You grow. You discover parts of yourself you never knew existed.

**CLAIRE**: 
And her?

**DAVID**: 
Jessica learns too. You both do. Together.

**CLAIRE**: *(to Jessica)*
And you're... okay with this?

**JESSICA**: *(still kneeling)*
I'm okay with whatever David thinks is best for my growth.

**CLAIRE**: *(realizing)*
You really are submitting to him.

**JESSICA**: 
And you're really surrendering to him.

*(They look at each other, understanding)*

**BOTH**: *(overlapping)*
**CLAIRE**: Maybe we can help each other  
**JESSICA**: Maybe we can learn together  
**BOTH**: Maybe this is what we both need  

### **The Acceptance**

**DAVID**: *(final verse)*
Both of you, both of you  
Are here because you choose  
To explore what you're capable of  
To discover what you could lose  

And what you could gain  
In the space between pleasure and pain  
Between safety and risk  
Between what is and what could exist  

**CLAIRE**: *(slowly kneeling beside Jessica)*
I don't know what I'm doing.

**JESSICA**: *(taking her hand)*
Neither did I, at first.

**DAVID**: *(approaching both women)*
You're learning. Both of you. Together.

**BOTH**: *(final harmony)*
Both of us, both of us  
Here in this moment of choice  
Both of us, both of us  
Finally finding our voice  

Not the voice that performs  
Not the voice that hides  
But the voice that transforms  
When it finally decides  

To be real, to be seen  
To be everything we've never been  

### **The Ending**

*(Music fades. The three of them sit in the intimate lighting)*

**DAVID**: 
This is where your real education begins.

**CLAIRE**: 
What happens now?

**DAVID**: 
Now you both learn what it means to be truly yourselves.

**JESSICA**: 
Together?

**DAVID**: 
Together.

*(CLAIRE looks at JESSICA, then at DAVID)*

**CLAIRE**: 
I never thought... I never imagined...

**DAVID**: 
That's the point, Claire. You've been living in your imagination for twenty-five years. Now you get to live in reality.

*(Lights begin to fade)*

**JESSICA**: *(to Claire)*
Are you scared?

**CLAIRE**: *(honest)*
Terrified.

**JESSICA**: 
Good. That means it's real.

*(Final moment of the three of them together as lights fade to black)*

**END OF ACT I**
