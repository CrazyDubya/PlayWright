## **SCENE 2 SCRIPT**

### **Opening**
*(Lights up on split stage. DAVID sits at an elegant desk with multiple monitors showing Jessica's social media accounts, financial data, and neighborhood surveillance feeds. JESSICA's space is cluttered with ring lights, cameras, costumes, and props. She's setting up for content creation.)*

**DAVID**: *(reviewing data on his screens)*
Subscriber count up twelve percent. Revenue stream steady. 
*(He types a message)*
"Good morning, pet. Time for your daily check-in."

*(JESSICA's phone buzzes. She immediately stops what she's doing and reads.)*

**JESSICA**: *(excited, typing back)*
"Good morning, Sir. Ready for instructions."

**DAVID**: *(typing)*
"Today's theme: 'Suburban wife discovers her needs.' Wardrobe: the blue dress from Tuesday. Remember - authentic vulnerability sells better than performed submission."

**JESSICA**: *(typing)*
"Yes, Sir. Should I mention the neighbor situation?"

**DAVID**: *(pausing, considering)*
"Not yet. Keep the focus on your journey. The audience isn't ready for complications."

*(He leans back, studying her through the camera feed)*

But I am.

### **SONG: "MY WILLING TOY"**
*(David and Jessica's established dynamic)*

**DAVID**: *(starting quietly, to himself)*
She came to me broken, desperate to please  
Adoption trauma written in her need to be seen  
I could have healed her, could have helped her grow  
Instead I found a use for her need to be owned  

*(JESSICA begins her routine, unaware of his observation)*

**JESSICA**: *(setting up camera)*
Ring light perfect, angle just right  
Another day performing my authentic life  
He chose me, he wants me, he sees who I am  
Even if it's just for the camera, I'm part of his plan  

**DAVID**: *(building)*
She thinks this is love, this attention I give  
She thinks being used means she's learning to live  
But I'm just a businessman with a broken toy  
Who pays me to play with her desperate joy  

**JESSICA**: *(to her camera)*
"Good morning, beautiful souls! It's your girl Jessica  
Day fifteen of my awakening journey  
Today we're exploring what it means to surrender..."  

*(She poses, performs, but her voice becomes more real)*

But when the camera's off and the lights go down  
I'm still the little girl who was never found  
By parents who wanted me, not saved me  
Who chose me because they loved me, not pitied me  

**DAVID**: *(watching her perform)*
She's good at this, I'll give her that  
Playing vulnerable while staying safe  
Selling her trauma like it's empowerment  
While I count the money that her pain has made  

*(His tone shifts, becoming more complex)*

But lately I've been wondering  
What would happen if I cared?  
What would happen if I loved her  
Instead of just keeping her scared?  

**JESSICA**: *(finishing her content)*
"Remember, beautiful souls, you are worthy of love  
You are worthy of being chosen  
You are worthy of someone's complete attention..."  

*(She turns off the camera, and her performance drops)*

Even if you have to pay for it  
Even if you have to perform for it  
Even if you have to break yourself  
To earn it  

**BOTH**: *(overlapping, different melodies)*
**DAVID**: She's my willing toy, my profitable pet  
**JESSICA**: He's my chosen master, my safety net  
**DAVID**: I wind her up and watch her dance  
**JESSICA**: He gives me purpose, gives me chance  
**DAVID**: For money, for power, for control  
**JESSICA**: To matter, to belong, to be whole  
**BOTH**: This is what we call love  
This is what we call enough  

### **Transition - David's Decision**
*(DAVID closes Jessica's feed and opens surveillance footage of the neighborhood)*

**DAVID**: *(to himself)*
Three years of the same routine. Jessica performs, subscribers pay, I profit. Predictable. Safe. Boring.

*(He pulls up footage of Claire from this morning)*

But this one... this one was different. She responded to my command without training, without negotiation. Natural submission. Authentic need.

*(He studies Claire's image)*

Jessica is my business. But Claire... Claire could be my art.

*(He picks up his phone)*

**DAVID**: *(typing to Jessica)*
"Change of plans. Cancel today's content. I have a new project that requires your... assistance."

### **Memory Sequence - Jessica's Backstory**
*(Memory space lights up. Young JESSICA with ADOPTIVE PARENTS)*

**ADOPTIVE MOTHER**: *(in memory)*
We tried for so long to have our own children, Jessica. You're our miracle.

**YOUNG JESSICA**: *(in memory)*
But what if you had gotten pregnant? Would you still have wanted me?

**ADOPTIVE FATHER**: *(in memory)*
Of course, sweetheart. You're our daughter now.

**YOUNG JESSICA**: *(in memory)*
But I'm not really yours, am I? I'm just... the backup plan.

*(Memory fades. Present JESSICA stares at David's message)*

**JESSICA**: *(to herself)*
A new project. Someone else to assist with. Someone else he's chosen.

*(She types back)*

"Of course, Sir. Whatever you need."

*(She pauses, then adds)*

"Will I still be... useful to you?"

*(She deletes the question before sending)*

### **David's Memory Sequence**
*(Memory space lights up. DAVID with SARAH, his deceased wife)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory, during a scene)*
I trust you completely, David. You see parts of me I didn't know existed.

**DAVID**: *(in memory)*
That's what dominance is, love. Not taking control, but helping someone discover their own power.

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me something. If anything happens to me, don't let my death make you stop caring for people. Don't let grief turn you into someone who uses instead of loves.

**DAVID**: *(in memory)*
Nothing's going to happen to you.

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me, David.

**DAVID**: *(in memory)*
I promise.

*(Memory fades. Present DAVID stares at Sarah's photo, then at Claire's surveillance image)*

**DAVID**: *(to Sarah's photo)*
I'm sorry, love. I became exactly what you were afraid I'd become.

*(He looks at Claire's image)*

But maybe... maybe this one can remind me who I used to be.

### **Jessica's Response**
*(JESSICA reads David's message about the "new project")*

**JESSICA**: *(to her camera, but not recording)*
Day fifteen of my awakening journey, and I'm about to learn what it feels like to be replaced.

*(She looks at herself in the ring light)*

But that's okay. That's what I'm for. That's what I've always been for. The temporary choice until something better comes along.

*(She starts to cry, then stops herself)*

No. No crying. Crying isn't content. Crying doesn't pay the bills.

*(She turns the camera back on)*

"Hey beautiful souls, change of plans for today. Sometimes awakening means learning to share your journey with others..."

### **Final Moment**
*(DAVID closes his laptop and stands)*

**DAVID**: *(to himself)*
Jessica is my willing toy. Predictable, profitable, safe.

*(He looks toward Claire's house)*

But Claire... Claire is my chance to remember what it feels like to create something beautiful instead of just breaking something that's already broken.

*(He exits. JESSICA continues her performance for the camera)*

**JESSICA**: *(to camera)*
"Remember, beautiful souls, being chosen isn't about being the only choice. It's about being grateful for whatever attention you receive..."

*(Her voice breaks slightly)*

"Even when you know it's temporary."

*(Lights fade as she continues her performance)*
