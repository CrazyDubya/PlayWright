## **SCENE 2 SCRIPT**

### **Opening - The Morning After**
*(Lights up on David's study. He sits at his desk, but the monitors are off. He's staring at a photo of Sarah, then at his phone showing messages from both Claire and Jessica.)*

**DAVID**: *(to Sarah's photo)*
Well, love, I did exactly what you were afraid I'd do. I turned caring into collecting.

*(He picks up his phone, reads Claire's text)*

"Thank you for last night. I've never felt so... alive. And scared. And confused. Is this what you meant by learning?"

*(He reads Jessica's text)*

"Sir, last night was incredible content. My subscribers are going to love the hints I can drop about exploring with others. When can we do it again?"

*(He sets the phone down)*

Content. She's already turning it into content.

### **Memory Sequence - Sarah's Warning**
*(Memory space lights up. SARAH appears, as she was before her death)*

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me something, David. If anything happens to me, don't let my death make you stop caring for people.

**DAVID**: *(in memory)*
Nothing's going to happen to you.

**SARAH**: *(in memory)*
Promise me you won't use your skills to control people instead of loving them. Promise me you won't turn dominance into manipulation.

**DAVID**: *(in memory)*
I promise, love. I promise.

*(Memory fades. Present David stares at the photo)*

**DAVID**: *(to the photo)*
I broke that promise, didn't I? Jessica is my manipulation. My business. My way of feeling powerful without feeling vulnerable.

*(He picks up his phone again)*

But Claire...

### **SONG: "TOY AND PRIZE"**
*(David's internal conflict)*

**DAVID**: *(starting quietly)*
Jessica is simple, Jessica is clear  
A broken little toy that I keep here  
For my amusement, for my use  
Easy to control, easy to abuse  

*(Mechanical, cold)*
Wind her up and watch her dance  
Give her money, give her chance  
To feel special, feel desired  
While I pull the strings I've wired  

Into her adoption trauma  
Into her desperate need for drama  
She's a toy, just a toy  
Built for my destructive joy  

*(Music shifts, becoming more complex)*

But Claire... Claire is different  
Claire was never meant to be  
More than just another toy  
In my suburban inventory  

But Claire... Claire is different  
And I don't know what that means  
When a predator finds a prize  
In his collection of broken things  

*(Building intensity, showing internal war)*

What is this feeling?  
What is this need?  
To protect her, to keep her  
To actually feed  

Her growth, her pleasure  
Not just my own  
To build her up  
Not tear her down  

*(Voice breaking)*
This isn't how this works  
This isn't who I am  
I'm the man who breaks Jessica  
I'm not supposed to understand  

Love, or care, or genuine connection  
I'm supposed to be above  
The messy complications  
Of actually falling in love  

*(Final verse, desperate)*

Jessica is my toy, my creation  
Claire is my prize, my confusion  
One I control completely  
One controls my delusion  

That I could be something more  
Than the monster that I am  
That I could love without destroying  
That I could be a better man  

*(Music fading, unresolved)*

Jessica is my toy  
Claire is my prize  
But which one shows me  
Who I really am inside?  

### **The Phone Call**
*(David's phone rings. He sees it's Jessica and answers)*

**DAVID**: 
Good morning, Jessica.

**JESSICA**: *(voice excited)*
Sir! I've been up all night editing content. The hints I can drop about last night are going to drive my subscribers crazy. When can we schedule the next session?

**DAVID**: *(pause)*
Jessica, last night wasn't a session.

**JESSICA**: 
I know, Sir. It was so much more. It was authentic exploration of polyamorous power dynamics. My audience is going to eat it up.

**DAVID**: *(realizing)*
Your audience.

**JESSICA**: 
Yes, Sir. I'm thinking we could do a whole series. "Suburban Wife Shares Her Dom." The revenue potential is incredible.

*(David hangs up without responding)*

**DAVID**: *(to himself)*
Revenue potential. She's already monetizing what happened.

*(His phone buzzes with a text from Claire)*

**CLAIRE**: *(text)*
"I keep thinking about what you said - that I surrender while Jessica submits. I'm not sure I understand the difference, but I felt it last night. Is it wrong that I want to understand more?"

*(David stares at the text)*

**DAVID**: *(to Sarah's photo)*
She wants to understand. Not perform, not monetize. Understand.

### **Memory Sequence - Last Night**
*(Memory space lights up showing moments from the previous evening)*

**MEMORY JESSICA**: *(performing even in intimacy)*
"This is so beautiful, Sir. So authentic. My followers are going to love hearing about this journey."

**MEMORY CLAIRE**: *(genuine vulnerability)*
"I don't know what I'm doing. I'm scared. But I trust you."

*(Memory fades)*

**DAVID**: *(to himself)*
Jessica performed even in surrender. Claire surrendered even in performance.

*(He picks up his phone to respond to Claire, then stops)*

What am I doing? What am I becoming?

### **The Decision**
*(David stands, pacing)*

**DAVID**: 
I set this up to be simple. Jessica as my business, my predictable toy. Claire as my... what? My prize? My redemption?

*(He looks at Sarah's photo)*

You warned me about this, didn't you? You knew that if I used my dominance to avoid grief instead of process it, I'd become exactly this - a man who collects broken women instead of loving whole ones.

*(He picks up his phone)*

But what if... what if I could love Claire without destroying her? What if I could help Jessica without using her?

*(He starts typing a response to Claire)*

"The difference is that submission is something you do. Surrender is something you are. Come to dinner tonight. Alone. We need to talk."

*(He sends the message, then immediately types another to Jessica)*

"We need to discuss boundaries around content creation. This isn't a business arrangement."

*(He sends that message too)*

**DAVID**: *(to Sarah's photo)*
I don't know if I can keep the promise I made to you, love. But maybe... maybe I can try to remember who I was when I made it.

*(Lights fade as he sits back down, staring at both phones)*
