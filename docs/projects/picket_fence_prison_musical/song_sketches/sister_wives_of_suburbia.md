## LYRICS SKETCH

### **Opening - Confrontational**
**CLAIRE**: You think you know what David wants from me?  
**JESSICA**: Honey, I know exactly what he needs  
**CLAIRE**: You're just another conquest in his game  
**JESSICA**: At least I'm not pretending I'm the same  
**BOTH**: Perfect little housewife that I used to be  

### **Verse 1 - Recognition**
**CLAIRE**: Wait... you feel it too, don't you?  
**JESSICA**: Feel what?  
**CLAIRE**: That emptiness inside  
**JESSICA**: The need to be... something more than what we show  
**CLAIRE**: Something we're not supposed to hide  

### **Chorus - Realization**
**BOTH**: 
We've been fighting for the scraps  
Of a man who set the traps  
We've been dancing to his tune  
While he watches us consume  
Each other for his pleasure  
We're both just his treasure  
To be played against each other  

**CLAIRE**: Sister...  
**JESSICA**: We should be like mother  
**BOTH**: And daughter, not like rivals  
Fighting for our survivals  

### **Bridge - Shared Truth**
**JESSICA**: I was adopted, never felt like I belonged  
**CLAIRE**: My mother had an affair, I've been proving her wrong  
**JESSICA**: Every day of my life  
**CLAIRE**: Every day of my life  
**BOTH**: Trying to be the perfect wife  
To make up for their mistakes  
Whatever it takes  

### **Final Chorus - Harmony**
**BOTH**:
We are the sister wives of suburbia  
Sharing the same man, the same hysteria  
But what if we chose each other instead?  
What if we lifted each other up instead of playing dead?  

**CLAIRE**: You're not my competition  
**JESSICA**: You're my recognition  
**BOTH**: That I'm not alone in this  
That there's another way to exist  
Than fighting for his attention  
We could build our own dimension  
Where we're enough  
Just as we are  
Sister wives of suburbia
