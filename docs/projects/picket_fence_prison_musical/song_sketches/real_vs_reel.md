## LYRICS SKETCH

### **Opening - The Setup**
**JESSICA**: *(filming herself)*
"Hey beautiful souls, I'm here with Claire  
Who's also on her awakening journey, and I want to share—"  

**CLAIRE**: *(stepping away from camera)*
Turn it off, Jessica.  

**JESSICA**: But this could go viral! Our friendship, our growth—  

**CLAIRE**: This isn't content. This is my life.  

### **Verse 1 - JESSICA**
*(Still performing for camera)*

Why won't you share your story with the world?  
Your transformation should be unfurled  
For other women who need to see  
That suburban wives can be set free  

Think of all the lives we could change  
If we put our journey on the stage  
Of social media, let them learn  
From the bridges that we burn  

### **Verse 1 - CLAIRE**
*(Authentic, no performance)*

Because my truth isn't entertainment  
My growth isn't your engagement  
Bait for followers who want to see  
A woman's sexuality  

Packaged neat and trending clean  
For their voyeuristic screen  
My submission isn't your content  
My awakening isn't your moment  

### **Chorus - JESSICA**
*(Electronic backing, auto-tuned)*

I'm keeping it real on my reel  
Showing the world how I feel  
Every moment, every sensation  
Shared with my online nation  

This is authentic, this is true  
I'm inspiring me and you  
To live out loud, to be seen  
To break free from the routine  

### **Chorus - CLAIRE**
*(Acoustic backing, raw vocals)*

But real isn't reel, can't you see?  
Truth isn't performed for free  
Likes and hearts from strangers who  
Don't know the real me or you  

Authentic means when no one's watching  
When your soul is finally talking  
Not to followers, not to fans  
But to your own two hands  

### **Bridge - The Confrontation**
**CLAIRE**: You're performing submission like it's a trend  
**JESSICA**: You're gatekeeping like you're the end  
**CLAIRE**: All authority on what's real  
**JESSICA**: At least I'm helping others heal  
**CLAIRE**: By commodifying your pain?  
**JESSICA**: By showing them they're not insane  
**CLAIRE**: For wanting more than what they have  
**JESSICA**: You're just jealous of my path  
**CLAIRE**: To viral fame and brand deals  
**JESSICA**: At least I'm honest about how it feels  
**BOTH**: To want something more than this  

### **Final Confrontation**
**JESSICA**: *(desperate)*
Without the camera, without the views  
How do I know what I choose  
Is real or just another lie  
I tell myself to get by?  

**CLAIRE**: *(gentle but firm)*
That's exactly the point, don't you see?  
When you stop performing, you're free  
To discover what you actually want  
Instead of what gets you font  
Page coverage and trending tags  
Your real self is what never sags  
Under the weight of others' eyes  
It's the truth beneath the lies  

### **Outro - Unresolved**
**JESSICA**: *(camera still rolling)*
"So that's our authentic conversation  
About truth and transformation..."  

**CLAIRE**: *(walking away)*
And you're still performing it.  

*(Music ends with electronic glitch as Jessica realizes her camera captured everything)*
