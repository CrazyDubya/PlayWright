## LYRICS SKETCH

### **Verse 1 - MICHAEL**
*(Sitting with phone, wife invisible beside him)*

Another notification, another ping  
Another dopamine hit from this digital thing  
She's talking but I'm scrolling  
Through a life that isn't real  
While the woman next to me  
Is something I can't feel  

### **Chorus - MALE ENSEMBLE**
*(Robotic movements, staring at screens)*

We are the digital ghosts  
Haunting our own homes  
Present but not here  
Connected but alone  
We're all logged in  
But no one's really home  

### **Verse 2 - ROBERT**
*(Gaming headset on, Jessica trying to get his attention)*

Forty-seven kills, my ranking's going up  
While my marriage slowly empties like a broken cup  
She used to try to talk to me  
Now she doesn't even try  
I'm winning every battle  
But I'm losing my real life  

### **Bridge - Building Awareness**
*(Music becomes more human, less electronic)*

**MICHAEL**: When did I stop seeing her?  
**ROBERT**: When did she become a blur?  
**ENSEMBLE**: We've been sleepwalking through our lives  
**ALL**: While our women pay the price  

*(Final chorus with growing horror at what they've become)*

We are the digital ghosts...  
And we're haunting the ones we love most
