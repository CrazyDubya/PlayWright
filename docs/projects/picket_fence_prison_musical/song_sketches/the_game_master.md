## LYRICS SKETCH

### **Verse 1 - The Control**
*(David in his study, looking at photos/surveillance of the neighborhood)*

I've been moving pieces on this suburban board  
Every secret, every desire, every discord  
You think you're living your lives, making your choices  
But I've been orchestrating all your voices  

Claire thinks she's discovering herself  
Jessica believes she's competing for wealth  
Of attention and power and control  
But I'm the one who's been writing their roles  

### **Pre-Chorus**
Because control is the only thing that makes sense  
When everything else can be taken in an instant  
If I can predict it, if I can direct it  
Then maybe this time I can protect it  

### **Chorus - The Game Master**
I am the game master of Magnolia Heights  
I know your weaknesses, I know your fights  
Every marriage, every secret, every shame  
You're all just players in my elaborate game  

And when you think you're finally free  
You're just dancing to the symphony  
That I composed in my grief and rage  
Welcome to my suburban stage  

### **Verse 2 - The Manipulation**
*(Moving through the neighborhood in his mind)*

Michael's lost in his digital maze  
While Claire awakens from her suburban haze  
Robert's gaming while Jessica performs  
I created all these perfect storms  

Ring doorbells are my eyes  
Social media feeds my lies  
Every coffee date, every chance meeting  
I've been pulling strings, orchestrating, competing  

### **Bridge - The Pain Revealed**
*(Music becomes vulnerable, David's mask slipping)*

But you want to know the truth about control?  
It's what you grab when you're losing your soul  
Sarah died in my arms three years ago  
And I couldn't save her, couldn't make her stay  
So now I make sure everyone obeys  

*(Building intensity)*
If I can control how the story ends  
If I can manipulate and pretend  
That I have power over life and death  
Then maybe I can finally catch my breath  

### **Final Chorus - Desperate**
*(Full orchestra, David's voice breaking)*

I am the game master, but the game is playing me  
I thought control would set me free  
But every puppet string I pull  
Just makes my own heart more full  
Of the emptiness she left behind  
When she died and I lost my mind  

You think you're trapped in my design?  
I'm the one who's lost in time  
Trying to rewrite the ending  
Where love stops depending  
On my ability to control  
The uncontrollable  

### **Outro - The Admission**
*(Music fading, David alone)*

I am the game master...  
But I don't know how to stop the game  
I am the game master...  
And I'm going insane  

*(Whispered)*
Sarah... what have I become?
