## LYRICS SKETCH

### **Verse 1**
*(Jessica setting up her phone, perfect lighting)*

Ring light on, camera ready  
Gotta keep my content steady  
"Day three of my awakening journey"  
Hashtag authentic, hashtag yearning  

*(Posing, speaking to camera)*
"So I met this man who sees the real me"  
Angle's perfect, can't you feel me?  
"He's teaching me to surrender control"  
Gotta get this trending, that's my goal  

### **Chorus**
I'm going viral with my submission  
Every post about my new position  
Likes and hearts and shares ascending  
My authentic self I'm trending  

*(Phone notifications pinging)*
Ding! Another thousand views  
Ding! My story's breaking news  
"Suburban wife discovers kink"  
I'm famous faster than you think  

### **Verse 2**
*(More elaborate staging, costume changes)*

"Today he told me what to wear"  
Perfect caption, perfect hair  
"Learning to obey feels so freeing"  
But I'm just performing what I'm seeing  

In the comments, in the porn  
What a good sub should adorn  
"Daddy's little princess" in my bio  
But inside I feel like such a lie-o  

### **Bridge - The Crack**
*(Music glitches, auto-tune fails)*

Wait... do I actually like this?  
Or do I like the analytics?  
Am I turned on by his control  
Or by my follower goal?  

*(Trying to get back on track)*
No, no, keep it authentic  
Keep it real, keep it kinetic  
"This is my truth, this is my story"  
But whose truth? Whose glory?  

### **Final Chorus - Desperate**
I'm going viral with my submission  
But I've lost my own admission  
Of what I want versus what sells  
I'm trapped inside these digital cells  

Ding! Another brand wants to sponsor  
Ding! My "journey" they want to monster-ize  
"Suburban MILF finds her kink"  
But I don't know what I actually think  

### **Outro**
*(Phone battery dying, notifications stopping)*

Ring light fading, camera's dying  
In the silence, I'm just crying  
Who am I when no one's watching?  
When the content train stops clocking?  

*(Whispered)*
Is this real... or just performing?
