# DAVID STERLING - Lead Male / Dominant

## Basic Information
- **Age**: 45
- **Occupation**: Retired military contractor, now "consultant" (deliberately vague about his work)
- **Cultural Background**: Second-generation German-American, military family background
- **Physical Description**: Tall, lean, controlled presence - moves like someone comfortable with command. Salt-and-pepper hair, intense eyes, expensive but understated clothing
- **Voice Type**: Rich baritone with commanding presence

## Character Arc

### **Want vs. Need**
- **Want**: To find someone worthy of his complete attention and control
- **Need**: To heal from the trauma of losing his submissive wife and stop using control to avoid his own grief
- **Hidden Want**: To be vulnerable with someone again, to trust enough to let his guard down

### **Fatal Flaw**
Uses control and dominance to avoid processing his own grief and vulnerability. He's become addicted to the power because it makes him feel less helpless than he did when his wife died.

### **Character Journey**
- **Act I**: Orchestrating games to feel powerful and in control
- **Act II**: Forced to confront his own pain and the harm his games have caused
- **Resolution**: Learning to use his dominance to heal rather than to hide

## Background & Trauma

### **Family Secret**
His wife Sarah died during a BDSM scene three years ago. Not from the scene itself, but from a brain aneurysm that could have happened anywhere. David has been carrying guilt and hasn't practiced D/s since, but the grief is eating him alive. He's moved to the suburbs to escape his old life but brought his need for control with him.

### **Military Background**
Twenty years in military intelligence, specialized in psychological operations. He understands how to read people, how to find their weaknesses and desires. This makes him both an excellent Dom and a potentially dangerous manipulator.

### **Economic Status**
Wealthy enough to retire early from military contracting. His house is the most expensive on the cul-de-sac, but he lives alone. Money gives him the freedom to orchestrate elaborate psychological games with his neighbors.

## Relationships

### **With Claire (Primary Submissive)**
- Sees her authentic self beneath the suburban performance
- Recognizes her need for surrender and gives her permission to want things
- Their dynamic awakens his own capacity for care and protection
- She challenges him to be a better Dom, not just a more controlling one

### **With Jessica (Secondary Submissive)**
- Uses her competitive nature to create drama and maintain control
- Recognizes her trauma but exploits it rather than healing it
- Their dynamic is less healthy - more about his power than her growth
- She represents his old patterns of dominance without care

### **With Sarah (Dead Wife)**
- She was his first and only submissive before the neighborhood games
- Their relationship was built on mutual healing and growth
- Her death shattered his understanding of control and safety
- He's trying to recreate what they had but without the vulnerability

### **With Michael (Claire's Husband)**
- Sees him as weak and unworthy of Claire
- Manipulates him through his digital addictions and emotional absence
- Represents everything David despises about modern masculinity
- A convenient obstacle that justifies David's interference

## Contradictions & Complexity

### **Control vs. Vulnerability**
- **Surface**: Appears completely in control of every situation
- **Reality**: Using control to avoid dealing with his own helplessness and grief
- **Growth**: Learning that true dominance requires vulnerability and emotional risk

### **Care vs. Manipulation**
- **With Claire**: Genuinely wants to help her discover herself
- **With Jessica**: Uses her needs to serve his own psychological games
- **Internal Conflict**: Struggling to distinguish between healing and harming

### **Past vs. Present**
- **Before Sarah's Death**: Dominance was about mutual growth and healing
- **After Sarah's Death**: Dominance became about avoiding pain and maintaining control
- **Future**: Integrating the lessons of loss into a healthier practice of power

## Key Scenes & Songs

### **"No Panties Tomorrow" (with Claire)**
David's introduction to the audience through his seduction of Claire. Shows his ability to see through facades and his skill at awakening desire. Must establish him as magnetic and safe, not predatory.

### **"The Game Master" (Act II Solo)**
David's villain song where he reveals the extent of his manipulation of the entire neighborhood. His grief and need for control are exposed. The audience sees both his power and his pain.

*Sample lyrics:*
```
I've been moving pieces on this suburban board
Every secret, every desire, every discord
You think you're living your lives, making your choices
But I've been orchestrating all your voices

Because control is the only thing that makes sense
When everything else can be taken in an instant
If I can predict it, if I can direct it
Then maybe this time I can protect it
```

### **"After the Fall" (Final confrontation)**
David must choose between maintaining his games or risking genuine connection. His moment of vulnerability where he admits his fear and grief.

## Character Voice & Dialogue

### **Speech Patterns**
- Speaks in complete sentences, rarely uses filler words
- Asks questions that reveal more than they seem to
- Uses people's names frequently (psychological technique)
- Voice becomes softer and more commanding when establishing dominance

### **Command Style**
- Never shouts or threatens - power comes from certainty and presence
- Uses positive reinforcement more than punishment
- Commands are given as gifts, not demands
- Always leaves room for the submissive to choose

### **Emotional Moments**
- Becomes more formal when hurt or defensive
- German phrases emerge when he's emotional (learned from his grandmother)
- Silence is a tool he uses effectively
- Physical stillness that suggests coiled energy

## Costume & Visual Design

### **Daily Wear**
- Expensive but understated clothing - quality over flash
- Colors that suggest control: deep blues, charcoal, black
- Always perfectly groomed but not obsessively so
- Clothing that allows for movement and suggests physical capability

### **Power Scenes**
- Darker colors that create visual contrast with Claire's lighter tones
- Clothing that suggests authority without being costume-y
- Accessories that hint at BDSM (leather watch band, specific jewelry) without being obvious

### **Vulnerable Moments**
- Clothing becomes less perfect, more human
- Colors soften slightly
- Physical posture changes to show his emotional state

## Musical Considerations

### **Vocal Range**
- Rich baritone, F2 to F4 with occasional lower notes
- Voice should suggest both warmth and authority
- Capable of intimate, conversational delivery and full-voice commanding moments

### **Musical Themes**
- **Control motif**: Steady, measured rhythms that suggest certainty
- **Grief theme**: Minor key passages that reveal his hidden pain
- **Seduction leitmotif**: Chromatic, jazz-influenced passages
- **Vulnerability music**: Simpler, more open harmonies when he's honest

## Actor Requirements

### **Physical**
- Commanding presence without being physically intimidating
- Comfortable with stage intimacy and power dynamic scenes
- Able to convey authority through posture and movement
- Age range: 40-50 (must be believable as experienced Dom)

### **Vocal**
- Strong baritone with acting ability
- Comfortable with both intimate and commanding vocal styles
- Able to convey complex emotions through song

### **Emotional**
- Must avoid the "creepy Dom" stereotype while maintaining edge
- Able to show vulnerability without losing authority
- Complex enough to be both sympathetic and problematic
- Chemistry with multiple female co-stars

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

### **BDSM Community Representation**
- Consult with actual Dominants about authentic portrayal
- Show the difference between healthy dominance and abuse
- Emphasize the responsibility that comes with power
- Avoid stereotypes about Doms being damaged or abusive

### **Military Background**
- Research actual military intelligence and contracting work
- Avoid stereotypes about military trauma while honoring real experiences
- Show how military training can both help and hinder civilian relationships

### **German-American Heritage**
- Subtle cultural elements without stereotyping
- Connection to family history and values around control/order
- Language elements that emerge during emotional moments

## The Moral Complexity

David is neither hero nor villain - he's a man using his considerable skills to avoid dealing with his own pain. His dominance can be both healing and harmful, depending on his motivations and the needs of his partners.

The audience should understand that his control over the neighborhood comes from a place of grief and fear, not evil. But they should also see that his actions have real consequences for real people.

His journey is about learning to use his power responsibly - to heal rather than to hide, to serve others' growth rather than his own need for control.

### **Key Questions for the Actor**
- How does David's grief manifest in his need for control?
- What does he see in Claire that he didn't see in Jessica?
- How does his military training affect his approach to dominance?
- What would Sarah think of what he's become?
- How does he justify his manipulation of the neighborhood?
