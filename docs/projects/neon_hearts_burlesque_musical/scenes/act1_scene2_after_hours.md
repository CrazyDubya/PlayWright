# ACT I, SCENE 2: "AFTER HOURS"
## The Velvet Room - 2:00 AM

*The club is empty except for the ghosts of the evening's performance. Chairs stacked on tables, neon signs flickering like dying stars. RUBY sits at the bar in a silk robe, counting the night's take - pathetically small bills spread across the mahogany.*

*JACK emerges from the shadows. He's loosened his tie, rolled up his sleeves. The corporate armor is cracking.*

**RUBY** (Not looking up):
We're closed, Mr. Sterling.

**JACK** (Moving closer):
I know. I've been waiting.

**RUBY** (Finally looking at him, dangerous smile):
Waiting for what? The building to collapse on its own?

**JACK** (Sitting across from her):
Waiting to talk to you. Without the audience.

*She continues counting money, but her awareness of him is electric*

**RUBY** (Sarcastic):
How much? That's what you want to know, right? How much to make us disappear quietly?

**JACK** (Studying her):
Actually, I want to know why you do this.

**RUBY** (Laughing bitterly):
Do what? Strip for money? Honey, it's called survival.

**JACK** (Shaking his head):
No. Why you fight so hard for this place. It's just a building.

*RUBY's hands stop moving. The air crackles with danger.*

**RUBY** (Voice low, deadly):
Just a building?

*She stands, moves around the bar toward him. Every step is calculated seduction and threat.*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
You see faded velvet and cracked mirrors. You know what I see?

*She's close enough to touch now. JACK's breathing changes.*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
I see Stella teaching me how to sew a costume when I was twenty and pregnant and had nowhere else to go. I see Tommy carrying me to the hospital when I miscarried because he was the only family I had.

*Her voice breaks slightly, but she doesn't back down*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
I see Max giving me a job when no respectable theater would hire an unwed mother. I see fifteen years of women who came here broken and left here whole.

**JACK** (Quietly):
Ruby...

**RUBY** (Cutting him off):
So don't you dare call it "just a building." This place saved my life. And now you want to tear it down for what? Another casino? Another parking lot?

**JACK** (Standing, facing her):
A hotel. Luxury suites. My father's vision of the future.

**RUBY** (Stepping closer, dangerous):
Your father's vision. What about yours?

*The tension between them is suffocating. They're inches apart.*

**JACK** (Voice rough):
I don't get to have visions. I get to execute his.

**RUBY** (Studying his face):
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

*For a moment, the corporate mask slips completely. JACK looks young, lost.*

**JACK** (Vulnerable):
You think I want to do this? You think I enjoy destroying things that matter to people?

**RUBY** (Softer, but still guarded):
Then don't.

**JACK** (Bitter laugh):
You don't understand. My father doesn't make suggestions. He gives orders.

**RUBY** (Moving even closer):
And you always follow them?

**JACK** (Looking at her lips):
Always.

**RUBY** (Whispered):
Always?

*They're about to kiss when CANDY bursts through the back door, still in her costume but disheveled. She stops short seeing them together.*

**CANDY** (Breathless, excited):
Ruby! I've been looking everywhere for— Oh. Sorry, I didn't know you had... company.

*The spell breaks. RUBY steps back, walls going up.*

**RUBY** (Cool):
What is it, Candy?

**CANDY** (Glancing between them):
Maybe I should come back—

**RUBY** (Firmly):
What is it?

**CANDY** (Taking a breath):
I got a call. From the Flamingo. They want to audition me. For their new revue.

*Silence. The weight of betrayal hangs in the air.*

**RUBY** (Very quietly):
The Flamingo.

**CANDY** (Defensive):
It's just an audition. It doesn't mean anything.

**RUBY** (Turning away):
It means everything.

**CANDY** (Desperate):
Ruby, you have to understand. If this place is closing anyway—

**RUBY** (Whirling around):
If? IF? We haven't even started fighting yet and you're already jumping ship?

**CANDY** (Voice rising):
I'm being practical! I have a family to support!

**RUBY** (Hurt and angry):
We ARE your family!

**CANDY** (Cruel truth):
No, Ruby. You're my boss. And this job is ending whether I take the audition or not.

*The words hit RUBY like a physical blow. JACK watches, seeing the pain she tries to hide.*

**RUBY** (Voice hollow):
Get out.

**CANDY** (Pleading):
Ruby—

**RUBY** (Louder):
GET OUT!

*CANDY hesitates, then flees. RUBY stands alone, shaking with rage and hurt.*

**JACK** (Gently):
Ruby...

**RUBY** (Not turning around):
You should go too.

**JACK** (Moving toward her):
I don't want to go.

**RUBY** (Laughing bitterly):
What you want doesn't matter, remember? You always follow orders.

**JACK** (Touching her shoulder):
Not always.

*She turns, and he sees tears she's trying not to shed.*

**RUBY** (Broken):
She's right, you know. This place is dying. Maybe it's time to let it go.

**JACK** (Surprising himself):
Maybe it's time to fight for it.

**RUBY** (Looking at him):
Why would you say that?

**JACK** (Realizing as he speaks):
Because watching you talk about this place... I've never seen anyone love something that much. And maybe... maybe some things are worth more than money.

*They look at each other, both surprised by his words.*

**RUBY** (Whispered):
Your father won't like that attitude.

**JACK** (Moving closer):
My father isn't here.

*This time when they move toward each other, nothing interrupts. The kiss is desperate, hungry, full of everything they can't say.*

*When they break apart, both are breathing hard.*

**RUBY** (Against his lips):
This is a terrible idea.

**JACK** (Kissing her neck):
The worst.

**RUBY** (Pulling back to look at him):
You're going to break my heart.

**JACK** (Honest):
Probably.

**RUBY** (Smiling despite everything):
And I'm going to make your life hell.

**JACK** (Grinning):
I'm counting on it.

*They kiss again as the lights fade, neon signs flickering like dying stars around them.*
