# ACT I, SCENE 1: "NEON HEARTS"
## The Velvet Room - Saturday Night, 1963

*The curtain rises on pure sensual magic. The Velvet Room pulses with neon light - pink, blue, gold - casting everything in an otherworldly glow. Red velvet banquettes, crystal chandeliers hanging at dangerous angles, mirrors that have seen too much. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, perfume, and desperation disguised as glamour.*

*A live jazz quartet sits in the corner - piano, bass, drums, trumpet. The music is sultry, dangerous, alive.*

*RUBY VALENTINE stands center stage in a spotlight, wearing a sequined gown that catches every light. She's 35 but moves like liquid sex, every gesture calculated to make hearts stop. Behind her, the company prepares for the show - CANDY adjusting her stockings, STELLA pinning a feather in her hair, MAX counting the till.*

*The audience - both onstage and in the theater - holds its breath.*

**RUBY** (Speaking to the audience, voice like whiskey and smoke):
Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to The Velvet Room. Where dreams come to dance... and sometimes to die.

*She begins to move, and the music starts*

## SONG: "NEON HEARTS"

### **VERSE 1 - RUBY (Solo, establishing the world)**

**RUBY** (Sultry, but with an edge of desperation):
*Step into the light*
*Where the shadows play*
*Where the lonely hearts*
*Come to lose their way*
*In the neon glow*
*Of a Saturday night*
*Where everything's wrong*
*But it feels so right*

*We paint our faces*
*Like works of art*
*Selling pieces*
*Of our beating hearts*
*For the price of a drink*
*And a moment's thrill*
*In the neon light*
*Time stands still*

### **CHORUS 1 - COMPANY JOINING**

**COMPANY** (Building, seductive but tinged with sadness):
*Neon hearts*
*Beating in the dark*
*Neon hearts*
*Looking for a spark*
*In this velvet room*
*Where the dreamers come*
*To forget their pain*
*Till the morning sun*

*Neon hearts*
*Burning bright and fast*
*Neon hearts*
*Nothing good can last*
*But tonight we shine*
*Like diamonds in the rough*
*In this neon world*
*Where love ain't enough*

### **VERSE 2 - CANDY (Stepping forward, young and hungry)**

**CANDY** (Sweet voice with steel underneath):
*I came here with nothing*
*But a suitcase and a dream*
*Now I'm learning how to sparkle*
*In this neon-colored scheme*
*Ruby says I got potential*
*Says I got that special glow*
*But potential don't pay rent*
*And dreams don't always grow*

*Still I practice in the mirror*
*Every bump and every grind*
*'Cause somewhere in this city*
*There's a star I'm gonna find*

### **VERSE 3 - STELLA (Overlapping, wisdom and weariness)**

**STELLA** (Rich, weathered voice):
*Twenty years I've sewn these costumes*
*Twenty years of beads and lace*
*Watching girls become women*
*In this glittering, dangerous place*
*I've seen hearts break like champagne glasses*
*I've seen dreams go up in smoke*
*But I keep on sewing sequins*
*'Cause it's beauty for us broke*

### **BRIDGE - MAX (Cynical but caring)**

**MAX** (Speaking over music, then singing):
*You want to know the truth about this place?*
*It's not the fantasy they sell*
*It's rent money and grocery bills*
*It's heaven and it's hell*

*(Singing)*
*But when that spotlight hits you*
*And the music starts to play*
*For just one shining moment*
*All your troubles melt away*

### **VERSE 4 - TOMMY (Unexpected tenderness from the tough guy)**

**TOMMY** (Deep voice, protective):
*I stand here in the shadows*
*Keep the wolves away from sheep*
*These ladies are my family*
*Their secrets I will keep*
*I've done things I ain't proud of*
*Got blood upon my hands*
*But here I'm just a guardian*
*In sequined wonderland*

### **FINAL CHORUS - FULL COMPANY (Building to explosive climax)**

**ALL** (Voices layering, building intensity):
*Neon hearts*
*Beating in the dark*
*Neon hearts*
*Looking for a spark*

**RUBY** (Over the ensemble):
*We're broken and we're beautiful*

**CANDY** (Overlapping):
*We're hungry and we're proud*

**STELLA** (Adding harmony):
*We're whispers and we're thunder*

**MAX** (Cynical counterpoint):
*We're lost inside the crowd*

**TOMMY** (Bass line):
*But we're family*

**ALL** (Explosive finale):
*Neon hearts*
*Burning bright and fast*
*Neon hearts*
*Nothing good can last*
*But tonight we shine*
*Like stars against the black*
*In this velvet room*
*There's no looking back*

*We are the neon hearts*
*We are the midnight dreams*
*We are the broken beautiful*
*Nothing's quite what it seems*

*NEON HEARTS!*

*The music crashes to a stop. The lights snap to black except for a single spot on RUBY.*

**RUBY** (Speaking, intimate and dangerous):
And now... let the show begin.

*Lights explode back up as JACK STERLING enters from the back of the theater, wearing an expensive suit that screams money and power. The energy shifts - predator in the henhouse.*

**MAX** (Spotting him, voice sharp):
We're closed for private party, mister.

**JACK** (Smooth, but there's steel underneath):
Actually, I think you'll find I have every right to be here.

*He pulls out a legal document*

**JACK** (Continuing):
Jack Sterling. Sterling Development Corporation. I believe you've been expecting me.

*The music stops. The fantasy shatters. Reality crashes in like a sledgehammer.*

**RUBY** (All the seduction gone, pure steel):
You're the son of a bitch who wants to tear down our home.

**JACK** (Surprised by her directness):
I'm the son of a bitch who owns this building. As of midnight tonight.

*Silence. The weight of impending doom settles over the room.*

**CANDY** (Whispered):
What does that mean?

**JACK** (Looking around, taking in the faded glamour):
It means you have six weeks to find somewhere else to... perform.

**RUBY** (Moving toward him like a predator):
Six weeks to destroy fifteen years of my life?

**JACK** (Defensive):
Six weeks to relocate. I'm not unreasonable.

**RUBY** (Laughing bitterly):
Unreasonable? Honey, you just walked into our home and told us we're being evicted. That's not unreasonable - that's war.

*She steps closer, and despite himself, JACK is affected by her presence*

**RUBY** (Continuing, voice dropping to dangerous whisper):
But you made one mistake, Mr. Sterling.

**JACK** (Trying to maintain control):
What's that?

**RUBY** (Smile like a blade):
You walked into The Velvet Room. And in here... we don't go down without a fight.

*The lights snap to black*
