# ACT II, SCENE 2: "LAST DANCE" - TRANSCENDENT VERSION
## The Velvet Room - 10:00 PM - Final Performance

*The building has transformed into something beyond a nightclub - it's become a shrine, a courtroom, a sanctuary making its final plea. The neon lights burn with the intensity of stars about to go supernova. News cameras capture everything, but they feel like witnesses to something sacred rather than intrusions.*

*RUBY stands center stage in Stella's masterpiece - a gown that celebrates her pregnancy rather than hiding it. She's radiant, fierce, maternal, and unbreakable. This isn't a burlesque performance - this is testimony.*

*MICKEY sits at the piano, no longer invisible, playing with twenty years of suppressed love finally given voice. CANDY stands beside him, ready to sing the Polish songs she's just learned.*

*The audience - both live and watching through cameras - holds its breath. They sense they're about to witness something unprecedented.*

**RUBY** (Speaking to the cameras, to the audience, to the world):
My name is Ruby Valentine. But that's not the name I was born with. I was born Rosa Valentini, daughter of Italian immigrants who came here with nothing but hope.

*She touches her stomach*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
Fifteen years ago, I walked through those doors pregnant, scared, and alone. This place didn't just give me a job. It gave me a family. It gave me a future. It gave me the strength to become who I was meant to be.

*The building's lights pulse gently, supportively*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
Tonight, I'm pregnant again. And tomorrow, they want to tear down the only home my child will ever know. So this isn't just a performance. This is a love letter. To family. To sanctuary. To the idea that some things matter more than money.

*MICKEY begins playing - not the opening number, but something new, something that weaves together all their stories*

## SONG: "WHAT WE LEAVE BEHIND" - TRANSCENDENT FINALE

### **VERSE 1 - RUBY (Maternal strength)**

**RUBY** (Hand on stomach, singing to her unborn child):
*Little one inside me*
*Listen to this song*
*About the family*
*That made me strong*
*About the place*
*That taught me*
*Love is worth*
*Fighting for*

*When you're old enough*
*To understand*
*I'll tell you*
*About this sacred land*
*Where broken people*
*Became whole*
*Where art*
*Could heal*
*Any soul*

### **VERSE 2 - MICKEY & CANDY (Father and daughter, finally together)**

**MICKEY** (In Polish, then English):
*Córeczko, moja mała*
*Twenty years I waited*
*To sing with you*

**CANDY** (Harmonizing):
*Papa, I remember*
*The lullabies you sang*
*Before the world*
*Took you away*

**BOTH** (Together):
*But music*
*Kept us connected*
*Love*
*Found a way*
*To survive*
*The separation*
*To stay*
*Alive*
*In every note*
*We played*

### **CHORUS 1 - BUILDING ENSEMBLE**

**COMPANY** (Voices layering, building):
*What we leave behind*
*Isn't bricks and mortar*
*What we leave behind*
*Is love*
*Passed down*
*Like water*
*From one generation*
*To the next*

*What we leave behind*
*Is the knowledge*
*That family*
*Isn't blood*
*It's choice*
*It's showing up*
*When the world*
*Says you don't*
*Have a voice*

### **VERSE 3 - STELLA (Survivor's wisdom)**

**STELLA** (Holding up costumes like prayer flags):
*Every sequin*
*Is a memory*
*Every thread*
*A life*
*That mattered*
*I survived*
*The worst*
*Humanity*
*Could offer*
*But here*
*I learned*
*To create*
*Beauty*
*From the scattered*
*Pieces*
*Of broken*
*Dreams*

### **VERSE 4 - MAX (Tough love revealed)**

**MAX** (Voice cracking with unexpected emotion):
*Twenty years*
*I've counted*
*Money*
*But tonight*
*I'm counting*
*Blessings*
*Every girl*
*Who found*
*Her strength*
*Every woman*
*Who learned*
*Her worth*
*Every family*
*Born*
*From choice*
*Not birth*

### **BRIDGE - JACK (Transformation complete)**

**JACK** (To his father, who watches from the back):
*I was raised*
*To build*
*Empires*
*But I learned*
*To build*
*Love*
*I was taught*
*To value*
*Profit*
*But I chose*
*To value*
*People*

*This is*
*My inheritance*
*This chosen*
*Family*
*This is*
*My legacy*
*Love*
*Over*
*Money*

### **FINAL CHORUS - EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY**

**ALL** (Full voice, cameras capturing every moment):
*What we leave behind*
*Is stronger than buildings*
*What we leave behind*
*Is deeper than feelings*
*What we leave behind*
*Is proof*
*That love*
*Survives*
*Everything*

**RUBY** (Over the ensemble):
*We are the mothers*
*Who protect the future*

**MICKEY & CANDY** (Overlapping):
*We are the fathers*
*Who never abandon*

**STELLA** (Adding harmony):
*We are the survivors*
*Who create beauty*

**MAX** (Gruff but loving):
*We are the guardians*
*Of what matters*

**TOMMY** (Bass line):
*We are the protectors*
*Of the sacred*

**JACK** (Transformed):
*We are the children*
*Who choose love*

**ALL** (Final explosion):
*WHAT WE LEAVE BEHIND*
*LIVES FOREVER*
*IN EVERY HEART*
*WE TOUCHED*
*EVERY DREAM*
*WE NURTURED*
*EVERY SOUL*
*WE LOVED*
*BACK TO LIFE*

*The music reaches a crescendo, then suddenly stops*

*In the silence, RUBY speaks directly to the cameras*

**RUBY** (Quiet, powerful):
Tomorrow, they'll tear down these walls. But they can't tear down what we built inside them. They can't bulldoze love. They can't demolish family. They can't destroy the truth that some things matter more than money.

*She looks around at her chosen family*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
This baby will be born into a world where people stood up for what's right. Where family protected family. Where love won.

*The building's lights pulse one final time, as if saying goodbye*

**RUBY** (Final words):
Thank you, Velvet Room. Thank you for saving us all.

*As the lights fade, we see FRANK STERLING in the back, tears in his eyes, finally understanding what his son chose*

*The news cameras capture it all - the love, the loss, the triumph of the human spirit over corporate greed*

*But in the fading light, we see something else: moving trucks pulling up outside. The family isn't giving up - they're moving their sanctuary to a new location*

**CANDY** (As they begin to pack):
Where will we go?

**RUBY** (Hand on stomach, smiling):
Wherever family is welcome. Wherever love can grow.

**MICKEY** (Playing one last lullaby):
Home isn't a place. Home is who you choose to love.

*The building's lights fade completely, but the family's love burns bright as they carry their sanctuary with them into an uncertain but hopeful future*
