# ACT II, SCENE 1: "FINAL STAND" - TRANSCENDENT VERSION
## The Velvet Room - That Evening, 8:00 PM

*The building pulses with desperate energy. This is their last night, and everyone can feel it. The neon lights burn brighter, more urgent, as if the building itself is fighting for its life. The mirrors reflect not just the present, but glimpses of all the memories held within these walls.*

*The company has transformed the space into a fortress of art and love. Costumes hang like battle flags. Photographs of twenty years of performances cover every surface. The piano - Mickey's piano - sits center stage like an altar.*

*RUBY stands before a mirror, applying makeup with the precision of a warrior donning armor. Her pregnancy is more visible now - she's stopped hiding it. Her hand rests protectively on her stomach as she prepares for what might be their final performance.*

*MICKEY sits at the piano, but he's not hiding anymore. He plays openly, proudly, his twenty years of invisible love finally given voice. CANDY sits beside him, learning the Polish songs she should have known all along.*

*STELLA works frantically on a final costume - something special for tonight. Her hands move with the urgency of someone preserving beauty before it's destroyed.*

*MAX counts money, but it's not for profit - it's for survival. Escape funds. Legal fees. Whatever comes after tonight.*

*TOMMY stands guard at the door, but his gentleness shows through his strength. He's protecting more than a building - he's protecting a family.*

*JACK paces, phone in hand, making desperate calls to lawyers, journalists, anyone who might help. His corporate world is crumbling, but his chosen family is solidifying.*

*The building breathes with them, protective and proud.*

**RUBY** (To her reflection, but speaking to everyone):
Twenty-four hours. That's what Frank Sterling gave us. Twenty-four hours to say goodbye to fifteen years of my life.

*She touches her stomach*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
But this baby isn't going to be born into a world where bullies win. Where money matters more than family. Where love gets bulldozed for profit.

**MICKEY** (Playing a gentle melody):
*Córeczko*, what are you thinking?

**CANDY** (Looking up from the piano):
She's thinking like a mother. Like someone who has to protect the future.

**STELLA** (Not looking up from her sewing):
She's thinking like a woman who's tired of running.

**MAX** (Closing the cash box):
She's thinking like someone who's ready to fight.

**TOMMY** (From his post):
She's thinking like family.

**JACK** (Ending his call, frustrated):
The lawyers say we don't have a case. The permits are valid, the zoning is clear. Legally, my father can tear this place down tomorrow.

**RUBY** (Turning from the mirror):
Then we don't fight legally.

**JACK** (Confused):
What do you mean?

**RUBY** (Moving to center stage):
We fight with truth. With story. With the power of people who refuse to be invisible.

*The building's lights pulse in agreement*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
Tonight, we don't just perform. We document. We record. We make sure the world sees what they're destroying.

**CANDY** (Understanding):
A final performance that shows who we really are.

**MICKEY** (Nodding):
Not just entertainment. Testimony.

**STELLA** (Holding up the costume she's been working on):
Then you'll need this.

*She reveals a stunning gown - not sequined and flashy, but elegant and powerful. It's designed to show Ruby's pregnancy proudly, beautifully.*

**STELLA** (Continuing):
For a mother. For a fighter. For a woman who won't be ashamed of who she is.

**RUBY** (Touching the gown):
Stella...

**STELLA** (Firmly):
No hiding tonight. No pretending. You wear your truth like armor.

*JACK's phone rings. He answers, listens, his face changing*

**JACK** (Hanging up):
That was Channel 7 News. They want to do a story. "Last Night at the Velvet Room."

**MAX** (Suspicious):
Why? What's their angle?

**JACK** (Honestly):
Human interest. David versus Goliath. The little club that's fighting the big corporation.

**TOMMY** (Protective):
Could be a trap.

**RUBY** (Decisive):
Could be our chance. Let them come. Let them see what a real family looks like.

*The front door opens. FRANK STERLING enters with his security guards, but something's different. He looks older, more tired.*

**FRANK** (To the room):
I came to make one final offer.

**JACK** (Standing):
Father, we've been through this.

**FRANK** (Ignoring Jack, speaking to Ruby):
Miss Valentine. I'll buy you out. Fair market value for your... business. You can relocate. Start over somewhere else.

**RUBY** (Hand on stomach):
How much?

**FRANK** (Surprised by her directness):
Fifty thousand dollars. Cash.

*The room goes quiet*

**MAX** (Whistling):
That's... that's a lot of money.

**STELLA** (Quietly):
Enough to start over. Somewhere safe.

**CANDY** (To Ruby):
You could raise your baby without worrying about money.

*RUBY looks around at each face, then at the building itself*

**RUBY** (To Frank):
And all I have to do is walk away? Pretend this place never mattered?

**FRANK** (Nodding):
Clean break. No hard feelings.

**RUBY** (Moving closer to him):
Mr. Sterling, can I ask you something?

**FRANK** (Wary):
What?

**RUBY** (Genuine curiosity):
Do you have children?

**FRANK** (Glancing at Jack):
I have a son.

**RUBY** (Following his glance):
And what kind of world are you building for him?

**FRANK** (Defensive):
A successful one. A profitable one.

**RUBY** (Touching her stomach):
I'm building a world where families matter more than profit. Where art matters more than money. Where love matters more than power.

*She looks around at her chosen family*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
You can't buy that, Mr. Sterling. And you can't bulldoze it either.

**FRANK** (Frustrated):
Miss Valentine, be reasonable. This is business.

**RUBY** (Fierce):
No, Mr. Sterling. This is family. And family doesn't have a price.

*The building's lights pulse stronger*

**MICKEY** (Standing):
She's right. Some things are worth more than money.

**CANDY** (Joining him):
Like twenty years of invisible love.

**STELLA** (Adding her voice):
Like beauty created from trauma.

**MAX** (Surprising herself):
Like finding purpose after loss.

**TOMMY** (From his post):
Like protecting what matters.

**JACK** (To his father):
Like choosing love over legacy.

**FRANK** (Looking around at their united front):
You're all fools. Sentimental fools.

**RUBY** (Smiling):
Maybe. But we're fools who know what matters.

*She turns to the company*

**RUBY** (Continuing):
So what do you say? One last show? One last chance to show the world who we are?

**ALL** (Various affirmations):
Yes. Let's do it. One last show.

*The building's lights pulse in rhythm, as if applauding*

**FRANK** (To Jack):
This is your last chance to come home.

**JACK** (Looking at Ruby, then at his father):
I am home.

*FRANK stares at his son for a long moment, then turns and leaves with his guards*

**RUBY** (To the company):
Alright, family. Let's give them a show they'll never forget.

*As they begin preparing for their final performance, the building seems to breathe deeper, drawing strength from their unity*

*The news crew arrives, cameras rolling, as the chosen family prepares to fight for their sanctuary with the only weapons they have - truth, love, and the power of performance*

**RUBY** (Final line, to the building itself):
Thank you for saving us. Now let us try to save you.

*The building's lights pulse once, as if saying "you already have"*

*Lights fade as the final performance begins*
