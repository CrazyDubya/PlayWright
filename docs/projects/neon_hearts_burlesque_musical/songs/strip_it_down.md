## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - RUBY (Teaching, seductive)**

**RUBY** (Moving like liquid sex, voice like whiskey):
*You want to understand this world?*
*You want to see what's real?*
*Then stop looking with your mind*
*And start learning how to feel*
*The weight of every sequin*
*The cost of every smile*
*The truth behind the fantasy*
*That makes it all worthwhile*

*So strip it down*
*Strip away the judgment*
*Strip away the fear*
*Strip away everything*
*That brought you here*
*To destroy what you don't understand*

### **VERSE 1 RESPONSE - JACK (Mesmerized, fighting it)**

**JACK** (Loosening his tie, corporate armor cracking):
*I came here with a purpose*
*I came here with a plan*
*But watching you move like that*
*I'm forgetting who I am*
*Or maybe I'm remembering*
*Who I was before*
*The suits and the expectations*
*And my father's endless war*

*Against anything beautiful*
*Against anything real*
*Against anything that makes you*
*Actually feel*
*Something more than profit*

### **CHORUS 1 - BUILDING TENSION**

**RUBY** (Moving closer):
*Strip it down to skin and bone*
*Strip it down to truth*
*Strip away the lies you tell*
*About what you're supposed to do*

**JACK** (Responding despite himself):
*Strip away the corporate mask*
*Strip away the shame*
*Strip away the Sterling name*
*And all its bloody fame*

**BOTH** (Harmony, dangerous):
*Strip it down*
*Strip it down*
*To what we really are*
*Underneath the neon lights*
*We're just two beating hearts*

### **VERSE 2 - RUBY (More intimate, more dangerous)**

**RUBY** (Removing her gloves, each gesture calculated):
*You see this body as a weapon*
*You see this dance as sin*
*But let me show you something*
*About the power that's within*
*A woman who owns her desire*
*A woman who knows her worth*
*Who takes what she wants*
*And gives what she chooses*
*From the moment of her birth*

*This isn't degradation*
*This is liberation*
*This is taking back*
*What men tried to steal*
*Our bodies, our choices*
*Our right to feel*
*Powerful*

### **VERSE 2 RESPONSE - JACK (Jacket off, walls crumbling)**

**JACK** (Voice rougher, more honest):
*I've never seen power*
*Look quite like this*
*I've never felt danger*
*In a woman's kiss*
*But you're rewriting*
*Everything I thought I knew*
*About strength and weakness*
*About me and you*

*And what we could be*
*If I had the courage*
*To walk away*
*From everything*
*That made me*
*Into this*
*Hollow man*

### **BRIDGE - MUTUAL SEDUCTION**

**RUBY** (Circling him like a predator):
*Touch me*
*Not like you own me*
*But like you worship me*

**JACK** (Reaching for her):
*Teach me*
*How to be human*
*How to be free*

**RUBY** (Allowing the touch):
*Feel this*
*This is what's real*
*This heat between us*

**JACK** (Pulling her closer):
*This is what I want*
*More than money*
*More than power*
*More than my father's approval*

**BOTH** (Building to explosion):
*This moment*
*This truth*
*This fire*
*That burns away*
*Everything else*

### **FINAL CHORUS - COMPLETE SURRENDER**

**RUBY** (Full voice, no holding back):
*Strip it down to flesh and blood*
*Strip it down to need*
*Strip away the world outside*
*And let your heart just bleed*

**JACK** (Matching her intensity):
*Strip away the family name*
*Strip away the guilt*
*Strip away the empire*
*That my grandfather built*

**BOTH** (Explosive, desperate):
*Strip it down*
*Strip it down*
*To this moment*
*This choice*
*This chance*
*To be more*
*Than what we were*
*Before*

*Strip it down*
*To love*
*To truth*
*To the courage*
*To choose*
*Each other*
*Over everything*
*Else*

### **OUTRO - AFTERMATH**

**RUBY** (Breathless, vulnerable):
*Now you know*
*What this world*
*Really is*

**JACK** (Holding her):
*Now I know*
*What I*
*Really want*

**BOTH** (Quiet, intimate):
*And it's not*
*What we're*
*Supposed*
*To want*

*(They kiss as the music fades to silence)*

This is the moment everything changes - where business becomes personal, where enemies become lovers, where the real stakes of the musical are revealed.
