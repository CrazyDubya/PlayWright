## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE MEMORY**

**STELLA** (Quiet, haunted, working with trembling hands):
*These hands remember*
*Different needles*
*Yellow stars*
*Sewn with tears*
*On coats too thin*
*For winter fears*
*In a place*
*Where beauty died*
*Where hope*
*Was just a lie*
*We told ourselves*
*To survive*

*But I survived*
*When others didn't*
*I lived*
*When they were taken*
*And every day*
*I ask myself*
*Why me?*
*Why was I*
*Not forsaken?*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE GUILT**

**STELLA** (Building, voice breaking):
*Survivor's guilt*
*Is a heavy crown*
*That weighs your spirit*
*Down*
*Every breath*
*You take*
*Is borrowed*
*From the ones*
*Who didn't make it*
*Through*

*So what do you do*
*With stolen time?*
*What do you do*
*With borrowed rhyme?*
*You create*
*You build*
*You make things*
*Beautiful*
*For those*
*Who can't*

### **VERSE 2 - THE ESCAPE**

**STELLA** (Memory becoming clearer, more painful):
*I came to America*
*With nothing*
*But these hands*
*And the knowledge*
*That beauty*
*Can exist*
*Even in hell*
*If someone*
*Is brave enough*
*To make it*

*Found my way*
*To this velvet room*
*Where broken girls*
*Bloom*
*Into women*
*Who know*
*Their worth*
*And I sew*
*Their dreams*
*Into reality*

### **BRIDGE - THE PURPOSE**

**STELLA** (Rapid-fire, passionate):
*Every sequin*
*Is a prayer*
*Every bead*
*A memory*
*Of someone*
*Who can't*
*Pray anymore*
*Every costume*
*Is a resurrection*
*Of beauty*
*They tried*
*To kill*

*When Ruby*
*Puts on*
*This gown*
*She carries*
*My mother's*
*Spirit*
*When Candy*
*Dances*
*In these feathers*
*She honors*
*My sister's*
*Dreams*

### **VERSE 3 - THE THREAT**

**STELLA** (Voice growing stronger, defiant):
*Now they want*
*To tear this down*
*This sanctuary*
*I helped build*
*With needle*
*And thread*
*And love*
*And the determination*
*To never*
*Let beauty*
*Die again*

*But I've seen*
*Worse than*
*Bulldozers*
*I've survived*
*Worse than*
*Eviction*
*And if they think*
*They can destroy*
*What we've created*
*They don't know*
*What survivors*
*Are capable of*

### **FINAL CHORUS - THE TRIUMPH**

**STELLA** (Full voice, soaring, triumphant):
*Survivor's guilt*
*Becomes*
*Survivor's strength*
*When you realize*
*You were saved*
*For a purpose*
*To create*
*To nurture*
*To protect*
*The next generation*
*Of dreamers*

*So what do I do*
*With stolen time?*
*What do I do*
*With borrowed rhyme?*
*I fight*
*I build*
*I make things*
*Beautiful*
*And I teach*
*Others*
*To do*
*The same*

### **OUTRO - THE PROMISE**

**STELLA** (Quiet, determined, holding up the finished costume):
*This dress*
*Will outlive*
*The building*
*This beauty*
*Will survive*
*The destruction*
*Because I sewed*
*Into every seam*
*The promise*
*That love*
*Is stronger*
*Than hate*

*That art*
*Is stronger*
*Than commerce*
*That family*
*Is stronger*
*Than blood*
*And that survivors*
*Don't just*
*Survive*
*We thrive*

*(She holds the costume up to the light, and it sparkles like stars)*
