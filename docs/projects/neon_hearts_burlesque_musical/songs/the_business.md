# "THE BUSINESS"
## Act I, Song 3 - Jack's Conflict Solo

**SETTING:** Jack's sterile office in the Sterling Development building. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Vegas Strip, but he's not looking at the view. He's staring at blueprints for the hotel that will replace The Velvet Room. A photo of his father dominates the desk - intimidating even in stillness.

**FUNCTION:** Establish Jack's internal conflict between family duty and personal morality, his attraction to Ruby complicating everything.

**STYLE:** Contemporary musical theater with Italian-American family themes. Builds from corporate precision to emotional breakdown.

## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE LEGACY**

**JACK** (Looking at his father's photo):
*Third generation Sterling*
*Built this empire from the ground*
*Grandfather came with nothing*
*But determination and sound*
*Business sense and iron will*
*And maybe a few broken legs*
*Now we own half the Strip*
*And the city begs*

*For our approval, our investment*
*Our vision of what should be*
*Progress means demolition*
*That's the Sterling legacy*
*Tear down the old and broken*
*Build something clean and new*
*That's what Sterlings do*
*That's what I'm supposed to do*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE EXPECTATION**

**JACK** (Building intensity):
*It's just business*
*Nothing personal*
*It's just progress*
*Nothing sentimental*
*You don't let feelings*
*Cloud your judgment*
*You don't let conscience*
*Make you weak*

*It's just business*
*That's what Papa taught me*
*It's just money*
*That's what really matters*
*You take what you want*
*You crush what's in your way*
*That's the Sterling way*
*That's the price you pay*

### **VERSE 2 - THE DOUBT**

**JACK** (Softer, conflicted):
*But last night in that velvet room*
*I saw something I can't forget*
*Not just the woman with the fire*
*Though I'm not over her yet*
*I saw a family, a community*
*Something money can't create*
*And I'm the one who's gonna destroy it*
*Seal their fate*

*Ruby looked at me like I was*
*Everything that's wrong with this world*
*And maybe she's not far off*
*Maybe I'm just another rich boy*
*Playing with people's lives*
*Like they're pieces on a board*
*But what if there's another way?*
*What if there's something more?*

### **BRIDGE - THE REBELLION**

**JACK** (Rapid-fire, building rebellion):
*What if I said no?*
*What if I walked away?*
*What if I told Papa*
*I won't play this game today?*
*What if I chose love*
*Over profit margins?*
*What if I chose right*
*Over family expectations?*

*But Papa didn't build this empire*
*By being soft or kind*
*He built it by being ruthless*
*By leaving weakness behind*
*And if I show mercy*
*If I show I'm weak*
*He'll crush me like he crushes*
*Everyone else who speaks*
*Against the Sterling way*

### **CHORUS 2 - THE INTERNAL WAR**

**JACK** (Full conflict, torn apart):
*It's just business*
*But it feels personal*
*It's just progress*
*But it seems criminal*
*When you see the faces*
*Of the people you're destroying*
*When you feel the weight*
*Of the lives you're toying with*

*It's just business*
*But my heart says otherwise*
*It's just money*
*But her eyes tell different lies*
*About what matters*
*About what's really worth*
*Fighting for*
*Living for*
*Dying for*

### **FINAL VERSE - THE CHOICE**

**JACK** (With terrible clarity):
*So here I sit in my glass tower*
*Looking down at the world below*
*Holding blueprints for destruction*
*In my hands that shake and know*
*That I'm about to cross a line*
*That I can never uncross*
*That I'm about to choose*
*Between love and loss*

*Between the man I am*
*And the man I'm supposed to be*
*Between my father's approval*
*And my own integrity*
*Between the Sterling legacy*
*And a chance at something real*
*Between what I think*
*And what I feel*

### **OUTRO - THE DECISION DEFERRED**

**JACK** (Speaking, then singing quietly):
*(Speaking to his father's photo)*
*What would you do, Papa?*
*If you met someone who made you*
*Question everything?*

*(Singing)*
*It's just business*
*That's what you'd say*
*It's just business*
*There's no other way*
*But maybe*
*Just maybe*
*You're wrong*

*Maybe some things*
*Are worth more*
*Than money*
*Maybe some people*
*Are worth more*
*Than power*
*Maybe love*
*Is worth*
*Everything*

*(He picks up the phone, then puts it down)*
*(Music fades as he stares at the blueprints)*

## CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SERVED

**JACK'S ARC:**
- From dutiful son to questioning rebel
- From corporate automaton to feeling human
- From certain destroyer to conflicted protector
- From Sterling legacy to personal choice

**FAMILY DYNAMICS:**
- Italian-American expectations and pressure
- Three generations of ruthless business practice
- The weight of inherited guilt and power
- The cost of disappointing family

---

## TRANSCENDENT ELEMENTS

**CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY:** Italian-American family loyalty and expectations
**MORAL COMPLEXITY:** No easy choice between family and conscience
**ECONOMIC REALITY:** The machinery of gentrification and development
**CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE:** Corporate responsibility vs. profit
**MUSICAL INTEGRATION:** Song advances internal conflict while revealing backstory

**THIS SONG MAKES THE AUDIENCE:**
- **SWEAT** with the pressure of impossible choices
- **CRY** for the boy trapped in a man's ruthless world
- **SWOON** over his vulnerability beneath the corporate armor
- **LAUGH** at the absurdity of family "business" expectations
- **GRIN** at his growing rebellion against his father
- **ANGUISH** over the knowledge that love might not be enough

Jack becomes a complex romantic lead - powerful but trapped, wealthy but poor in spirit, capable of great harm but yearning for redemption.
