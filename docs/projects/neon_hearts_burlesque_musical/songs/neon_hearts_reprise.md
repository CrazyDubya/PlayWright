# "NEON HEARTS REPRISE"
## Act II, Song 9 - Final Company Reunion

**SETTING:** Six months later. A new space - smaller, scrappier, but alive with the same energy. It's not The Velvet Room, but it's home. The company has reunited, changed but unbroken. Even Candy has returned, humbled but welcomed back.

**FUNCTION:** Final statement that chosen family survives, that dreams adapt, that neon hearts burn eternal wherever love gathers.

**STYLE:** Triumphant reprise that transforms the opening number's desperation into hope, community, and unbreakable bonds.

## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - RUBY (Leading the new beginning)**

**RUBY** (In a simple but elegant costume, radiant with hard-won wisdom):
*Six months ago*
*We lost our home*
*Six months ago*
*We stood alone*
*But here we are*
*Still standing strong*
*Still singing*
*Our defiant song*

*The walls are different*
*The stage is small*
*But the love inside*
*Still conquers all*
*We are the proof*
*That family*
*Isn't a place*
*It's who you choose*
*To be*

### **VERSE 2 - CANDY (Humbled, grateful)**

**CANDY** (In simpler costume, no longer chasing false glamour):
*I chased the lights*
*Of bigger stages*
*I thought success*
*Came in wages*
*But standing there*
*In that spotlight*
*I felt so empty*
*So alone*
*So not right*

*The Flamingo*
*Wasn't family*
*It was just*
*A job*
*A paycheck*
*A lie*
*I told myself*
*About what*
*I needed*
*To get by*

### **CHORUS 1 - BUILDING REUNION**

**COMPANY** (Voices blending, stronger than before):
*Neon hearts*
*Still beating strong*
*Neon hearts*
*Still singing songs*
*Of love and loss*
*And finding home*
*In the people*
*Who won't let you*
*Face the world*
*Alone*

*We are the light*
*In the darkness*
*We are the hope*
*In the storm*
*We are the family*
*That love creates*
*When blood family*
*Isn't enough*
*To keep you*
*Warm*

### **VERSE 3 - STELLA (Maternal pride)**

**STELLA** (Surrounded by new costumes, still creating beauty):
*Every sequin*
*Still a prayer*
*Every costume*
*Still shows care*
*For the dreamers*
*Who need beauty*
*To remind them*
*They're alive*

*This new space*
*May be smaller*
*But the love*
*Grows taller*
*Every day*
*We choose*
*To stay*
*Together*
*And thrive*

### **VERSE 4 - MAX (Surprised by her own sentiment)**

**MAX** (Still tough, but openly loving):
*Twenty years*
*I ran that bar*
*Now I'm here*
*And here we are*
*Still pouring drinks*
*Still counting change*
*But nothing*
*Really*
*Has to change*

*When you got*
*Family*
*Like this*
*Every place*
*Becomes*
*Home*
*Every stage*
*Becomes*
*Sacred*
*When you're*
*Not alone*

### **BRIDGE - TOMMY & JACK (Unexpected harmony)**

**TOMMY** (Still protective, but peaceful):
*I guard this door*
*Like I did before*
*But now I know*
*What I'm protecting*
*Isn't just a place*
*It's grace*
*It's love*
*It's second chances*

**JACK** (Having chosen love over legacy):
*I walked away*
*From everything*
*My father built*
*But I found*
*Something*
*Worth more*
*Than guilt*
*Or money*
*Or power*
*I found*
*Family*

### **FINAL CHORUS - TRIUMPHANT CELEBRATION**

**ALL** (Full voice, triumphant, unbreakable):
*Neon hearts*
*Burning bright and true*
*Neon hearts*
*Me and all of you*
*We are the proof*
*That love survives*
*Everything*
*They throw at us*
*We are alive*

*We are the light*
*That won't go out*
*We are the song*
*They can't silence*
*We are the family*
*That love built*
*From broken pieces*
*And defiance*

**RUBY** (Over the ensemble):
*We are the neon hearts!*

**STELLA** (Overlapping):
*We are the midnight dreams!*

**CANDY** (Redeemed):
*We are the ones who came back home!*

**MAX** (Gruff but loving):
*We are the family that's never alone!*

**TOMMY** (Protective):
*We are the guardians of the light!*

**JACK** (Transformed):
*We are the ones who chose what's right!*

**ALL** (Final explosion):
*NEON HEARTS*
*FOREVER*
*NEON HEARTS*
*TOGETHER*
*NEON HEARTS*
*THAT BEAT AS ONE*
*OUR STORY'S*
*JUST BEGUN*

### **OUTRO - THE ETERNAL PROMISE**

**RUBY** (Speaking to audience, then singing):
*(Speaking)*
*They can tear down our buildings*
*They can scatter our dreams*
*But they can't destroy*
*What love creates*

*(Singing softly)*
*Somewhere tonight*
*A broken heart*
*Will find its way*
*To where we are*
*And we'll be here*
*With open arms*
*Ready to show*
*That family*
*Isn't blood*
*It's choice*

*And we choose*
*Each other*
*Every day*
*Every night*
*Every time*
*The world*
*Says we're*
*Not enough*

*We are*
*The neon hearts*
*And we*
*Will always*
*Burn bright*

*(Final tableau: the company in a circle of light, arms raised, unbreakable)*
