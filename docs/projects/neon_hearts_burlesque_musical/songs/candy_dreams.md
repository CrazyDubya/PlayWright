## SONG STRUCTURE

### **VERSE 1 - THE HUNGER**

**CANDY** (Looking at herself in the cracked mirror):
*In this cracked and broken mirror*
*I see someone else's face*
*Not the factory worker's daughter*
*From that cold Detroit place*
*I see sequins, I see spotlights*
*I see my name up in lights*
*I see everything I've dreamed of*
*Just beyond these sleepless nights*

*Mama works three jobs to feed us*
*Papa's gone, ain't coming back*
*And I'm dancing in my underwear*
*For tips and a snack*
*But I got something they don't see*
*I got fire in my soul*
*And I'll do whatever it takes*
*To reach my goal*

### **CHORUS 1 - THE DECLARATION**

**CANDY** (Building intensity):
*I want more than this*
*More than tips in a jar*
*I want my name in neon*
*I want to be a star*
*I want the world to know*
*That Candy Cane can shine*
*I want it all*
*And I want it to be mine*

*Dreams don't wait*
*For the loyal or the kind*
*Dreams are for the hungry*
*Dreams are for the blind*
*To everything but wanting*
*Everything but need*
*I'll plant my flag on stardom*
*Whatever the deed*

### **VERSE 2 - THE GUILT**

**CANDY** (Softer, conflicted):
*Ruby took me in when I was nothing*
*Taught me how to move, how to be*
*Stella made my costumes*
*Max believed in me*
*They're my family, they're my teachers*
*They're the ones who made me whole*
*But family don't pay the rent*
*And love don't reach my goal*

*I see the writing on the wall*
*This place is going down*
*And I can sink here with the ship*
*Or swim to higher ground*
*It ain't betrayal if it's survival*
*It ain't wrong if it's smart*
*Sometimes you got to break a few*
*To mend your own heart*

### **BRIDGE - THE JUSTIFICATION**

**CANDY** (Rapid-fire, convincing herself):
*The Flamingo's got real money*
*Real stages, real crowds*
*Not this faded velvet palace*
*Where dreams die in the clouds*
*Of cigarette smoke and whiskey*
*And bills that never end*
*I could send money to Mama*
*I could finally transcend*

*This neighborhood, this struggle*
*This hand-to-mouth existence*
*I could be somebody special*
*With just a little distance*
*From the guilt and the loyalty*
*That's holding me down*
*I could be the brightest star*
*In this whole damn town*

### **CHORUS 2 - THE ESCALATION**

**CANDY** (Full voice, no holding back):
*I want more than this*
*More than Ruby's approval*
*I want stages that matter*
*I want my removal*
*From this dying little world*
*To something big and bright*
*I want it all*
*And I'll take it tonight*

*Dreams don't wait*
*For permission or blessing*
*Dreams are for the ruthless*
*Dreams are for the pressing*
*Forward through the guilt*
*Forward through the pain*
*I'll be more than Candace Kowalski*
*I'll be Candy Cane*

### **FINAL VERSE - THE DECISION**

**CANDY** (With terrible clarity):
*So I'll go to that audition*
*I'll smile and I'll perform*
*I'll show them what I'm made of*
*In my sexiest form*
*And if they offer me the contract*
*If they want to make me theirs*
*I'll sign it without looking back*
*Despite Ruby's tears*

*'Cause in this world of neon hearts*
*And broken dreams for sale*
*The only way to make it*
*Is to never let yourself fail*
*And failure is staying loyal*
*When loyalty means you're poor*
*So I'm walking through that door*
*To something so much more*

### **OUTRO - THE TRANSFORMATION**

**CANDY** (Speaking, then singing softly):
*(Speaking to her reflection)*
*Goodbye, Candace Kowalski*
*Factory worker's daughter*
*Goodbye, little girl*
*Who believed in family*

*(Singing)*
*Hello, Candy Cane*
*Hello, bright new star*
*Hello, to the woman*
*Who'll go far*
*No matter what*
*It costs*
*No matter who*
*Gets lost*
*Along the way*

*(Music fades as she applies lipstick like war paint)*

## TRANSCENDENT ELEMENTS

**CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY:** Polish working-class background drives her choices
**ECONOMIC REALITY:** Poverty and family obligation motivate betrayal
**MORAL COMPLEXITY:** No clear right or wrong, just survival
**CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE:** Gig economy, loyalty vs. opportunity
**MUSICAL INTEGRATION:** Song advances plot while revealing psychology

**THIS SONG MAKES THE AUDIENCE:**
- **SWEAT** with the intensity of her ambition
- **CRY** for the family she's abandoning
- **SWOON** over her determination and beauty
- **LAUGH** at her brutal honesty about survival
- **GRIN** at her fierce refusal to stay small
- **ANGUISH** over the cost of her dreams

Candy becomes a complex anti-hero - someone we understand even as we judge her choices.
