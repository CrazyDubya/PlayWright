# NEON HEARTS: A BURLESQUE MUSICAL

## Core Concept

**Logline**: When the last independent burlesque theater in 1960s Las Vegas faces closure, a washed-up headliner and a naive newcomer must choose between saving the club that made them or pursuing the dreams that might destroy them.

**Central Theme**: In a world that sells fantasy, what's the price of keeping your own dreams alive?

---

## Setting & Atmosphere

**Location**: The Velvet Room - Last independent burlesque club on the Vegas Strip, 1963
**Time**: Six weeks before the club's forced closure
**Atmosphere**: Neon-soaked desperation where glamour masks heartbreak, where every performance might be the last

The club itself is a character - faded velvet, cracked mirrors, and dreams that refuse to die even as the bulldozers wait outside.
