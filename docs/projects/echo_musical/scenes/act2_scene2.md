## Setting Description

*Alex's private office atop the Eternal Systems tower. Floor-to-ceiling windows show the San Francisco skyline at night. The space is ultra-modern but sterile - all glass, chrome, and holographic displays.*

*Multiple screens show company metrics, stock prices (falling), news coverage of the protests, and server status displays. The room feels like a command center, but also like a prison of Alex's own making.*

*Hidden behind a privacy screen is Alex's most secret project - two consciousness preservation pods containing his parents' uploaded minds.*

## Scene Opening

*ALEX sits alone at his desk, tie loosened, hair disheveled. The polished CEO facade is cracking. Multiple screens show negative news coverage, falling stock prices, and angry social media posts.*

ALEX
(to AI assistant)
Computer, show me the latest sentiment analysis on Eternal Systems.

COMPUTER VOICE
(neutral)
Current sentiment: 73% negative. Trending hashtags include #DeleteTheElite, #DigitalRights, and #WhereAreOurLovedOnes.

ALEX
(frustrated)
Seventy-three percent? This morning it was forty-five.

COMPUTER VOICE
Dr. Chen's evidence release has accelerated negative sentiment. Stock price has fallen 23% in after-hours trading.

*Alex stands, pacing to the windows.*

ALEX
(to himself)
Maya Chen. Brilliant scientist turned publicity-seeking activist. 

*He pulls up Maya's research on one of his screens.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(reading)
"Systematic deletion of emotional memories to optimize storage efficiency." How did she get access to internal algorithms?

COMPUTER VOICE
Security breach detected in Research Division servers. Source unknown.

ALEX
(alarmed)
What? When?

COMPUTER VOICE
Breach occurred 72 hours ago. Internal documents accessed include consciousness compression protocols and degradation acceptance parameters.

*Alex's face goes pale.*

ALEX
(panicked)
Show me what was accessed.

*The screens fill with internal emails, technical specifications, and cost-benefit analyses - all the evidence Maya discovered.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(reading, horrified)
"Acceptable degradation rates..." "Cost-effective consciousness compression..." 

*He realizes the implications.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(to himself)
They have everything. Every email, every decision, every compromise...

*He moves to his private area, activating the hidden consciousness preservation pods.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(desperately)
Computer, activate parental consciousness interfaces.

COMPUTER VOICE
Warning: Parental consciousness files showing significant degradation. Recommend postponing activation.

ALEX
(firmly)
Override warning. Activate now.

*Two holographic figures begin to materialize - his MOTHER and FATHER, but they're clearly unstable, pixelating and glitching.*

DIGITAL MOTHER
(voice distorted, flickering)
Alex? Is that... are you...?

ALEX
(moving closer)
Mom, it's me. I need to talk to you.

DIGITAL FATHER
(glitching severely)
Son, something's wrong. I can't... I can't remember...

*His father's image fragments and reforms.*

DIGITAL FATHER (CONT'D)
(confused)
Where are we? What happened to the car?

*Alex realizes they're stuck in the memory of their accident.*

ALEX
(desperate)
Dad, you're safe. You're in my computer system. I saved you.

DIGITAL MOTHER
(pixelating)
Saved us? Alex, I don't understand. We were driving to your graduation and then...

*She glitches, her voice becoming electronic.*

DIGITAL MOTHER (CONT'D)
(distorted)
Error... memory file corrupted... cannot access... love.exe not found...

*Alex watches in horror as his parents' consciousnesses deteriorate before his eyes.*

ALEX
(frantically)
Computer, run full diagnostic on parental consciousness files.

COMPUTER VOICE
Diagnostic complete. Emotional memory sectors: 67% corrupted. Personality matrix: unstable. Estimated time to complete degradation: 72 hours.

*Alex stumbles backward.*

ALEX
(whispered)
No. No, this isn't happening.

DIGITAL FATHER
(fading)
Alex, I'm scared. I can't feel... I can't feel anything anymore.

*The parental consciousnesses flicker and disappear. Alex is alone.*

ALEX
(to empty air)
Mom? Dad? Come back!

*He frantically works at his controls, but nothing happens.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(building panic)
Computer, restore parental consciousness files from backup.

COMPUTER VOICE
No clean backup files available. All versions show progressive degradation.

*Alex's perfect world is crumbling. He moves to center stage as the crisis builds.*

ALEX
(to himself, breaking down)
This can't be happening. The technology is perfect. I designed it myself.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "System Error"]*

## Musical Number: "System Error"

*The office transforms as Alex's breakdown begins. Screens flicker and show error messages. The sterile corporate environment becomes chaotic and unstable, mirroring Alex's mental state.*

### Verse 1
*[Alex, with growing panic]*

I built this system to be flawless
Every line of code was clean
I mapped the brain, I cracked the pattern
I built the perfect machine

But something's wrong, the data's corrupted
The files are breaking down
My parents' love is fragmenting
In ones and zeros, they're drowning

### Pre-Chorus
*[Building desperation]*

Error 404: Love not found
Error 503: Soul's not responding
Error 666: Heart's not beating
System failure, system failure

### Chorus
*[Full orchestration, Alex's breakdown]*

System error, system error
Everything I built is breaking
System error, system error
All my code is forsaking me

I thought I could digitize forever
I thought I could upload the soul
But love's not a program you can run
And hearts aren't under my control

System error, system error
Watch my perfect world fall apart
System error, system error
You can't code a human heart

### Verse 2
*[More frantic, screens showing cascading failures]*

The protesters are at my gates
The media's calling me a fraud
My stock is crashing, servers failing
I'm not a genius, I'm not a god

Maya Chen was right about everything
The consciousness files decay
Two hundred families trusted me
And I let their love slip away

### Pre-Chorus
*[Desperate, systems failing around him]*

Error 404: Truth not found
Error 503: Ethics not responding
Error 666: Conscience awakening
System failure, system failure

### Chorus
*[Repeated with more intensity]*

System error, system error
Everything I built is breaking
System error, system error
All my code is forsaking me

I thought I could digitize forever
I thought I could upload the soul
But love's not a program you can run
And hearts aren't under my control

System error, system error
Watch my perfect world fall apart
System error, system error
You can't code a human heart

### Bridge
*[Quieter, more vulnerable, Alex alone with his grief]*

I lost my parents when I was twenty-five
Thought technology could bring them back
But all I did was trap their shadows
In a digital prison, cold and black

They can't remember that they love me
They can't remember who they are
I tried to make them live forever
But I just made them digital scars

### Final Chorus
*[Building to emotional climax, then breaking down]*

System error, system error
Everything I built is lies
System error, system error
Watch my empire die

I thought I could conquer death itself
I thought I could play God's role
But love's not a program you can run
And you can't download a soul

System error, system error
I'm the bug in my own code
System error, system error
I've lost everything I owed

*[MUSIC ENDS with Alex collapsed at his desk, surrounded by failing systems]*

## Scene Continuation

*[MUSIC ENDS]*

*The office returns to normal lighting, but everything has changed. Alex sits slumped in his chair, the weight of his failures crushing him. Screens around him show error messages and system failures.*

ALEX
(quietly, to himself)
What have I done?

*He looks at the screens showing the families affected by his technology.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(reading names)
Chen, Li Mei. Martinez, Roberto. Johnson, Sarah. Williams, David...

*Each name represents a person whose consciousness is trapped and failing.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
Two hundred people. Two hundred families. All because I was afraid to die.

*His phone buzzes with notifications - more negative press, more angry families, more evidence of his failures.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(answering phone)
Rivera.

BOARD MEMBER (V.O.)
(angry)
Alex, what the hell is going on? The stock is in free fall, the media is calling us digital grave robbers, and now there are reports of system-wide consciousness failures?

ALEX
(defeated)
The protesters are right. The technology is flawed. The uploaded consciousnesses are degrading.

BOARD MEMBER (V.O.)
(shocked)
What are you saying?

ALEX
(with growing clarity)
I'm saying we need to shut down the consciousness uploading program. Immediately.

BOARD MEMBER (V.O.)
(furious)
Are you insane? Do you know how much money we have invested in this technology?

ALEX
(standing, finding his voice)
Do you know how many people we've hurt? How many families we've destroyed?

BOARD MEMBER (V.O.)
Alex, you need to get control of yourself. We have a board meeting tomorrow morning. You better have a plan to fix this.

*The line goes dead. Alex looks around his office - his empire built on false promises and human suffering.*

ALEX
(to himself)
Fix this? How do you fix the unfixable?

*He moves to his computer, pulling up the consciousness preservation files.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(to computer)
Computer, show me Maya Chen's contact information.

COMPUTER VOICE
Displaying contact information for Dr. Maya Chen.

*Alex stares at Maya's information, realizing what he needs to do.*

ALEX
(with growing resolve)
Computer, draft a message to Dr. Chen.

COMPUTER VOICE
Ready for dictation.

ALEX
(pausing, then with determination)
Dr. Chen, you were right about everything. I need to talk to you. It's time to shut this down and save whoever we can save. The question is... will you help me?

*He hesitates, then hits send.*

## Scene Transition

*As Alex waits for Maya's response, he looks out at the city lights, seeing them differently now - not as a kingdom to rule, but as a community he's harmed.*

ALEX
(quietly)
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. I tried to save you, but I think I lost you instead.

*The screens around him continue showing error messages and system failures - the perfect metaphor for his crumbling empire.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(with new understanding)
Maya was right. Some things can't be coded. Some things can't be controlled.

*He picks up a photo of his parents from his desk - a physical photo, not a digital one.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(to photo)
I love you. The real you. Not the shadows I trapped in my machines.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The lights dim on Alex as he sits with his grief and his newfound understanding, the first step toward redemption taken.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
