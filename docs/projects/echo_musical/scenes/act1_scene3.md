## Setting Description

*The stage transforms into the sleek, ultra-modern headquarters of Eternal Systems. Floor-to-ceiling windows reveal a panoramic view of San Francisco. The space is dominated by a massive curved presentation screen and minimalist furniture that seems to float in mid-air.*

*Everything is white, chrome, and glass - a stark contrast to Maya's cluttered laboratory. Digital displays show stock prices, user metrics, and promotional videos for consciousness uploading. The overall effect is impressive but cold.*

*Center stage is a raised platform where Alex conducts presentations. Ensemble members move through the space as employees, all dressed in identical stylish uniforms, carrying tablets and moving with synchronized efficiency.*

## Scene Opening

*Lights up on the Eternal Systems lobby. MAYA enters, looking determined but slightly overwhelmed by the corporate grandeur. She approaches the reception desk where a perfectly groomed RECEPTIONIST greets her.*

RECEPTIONIST
(with practiced smile)
Welcome to Eternal Systems, where death is just a temporary inconvenience. How may I help you achieve immortality today?

MAYA
(taken aback by the slogan)
I... I need to speak with Alex Rivera. It's about one of your... clients.

RECEPTIONIST
(checking tablet)
Do you have an appointment? Mr. Rivera is quite busy disrupting the mortality industry.

MAYA
(firmly)
Tell him Dr. Maya Chen from Stanford is here about unauthorized consciousness preservation. I think he'll want to see me.

*The Receptionist's smile falters slightly as she makes a call.*

RECEPTIONIST
(into headset)
Mr. Rivera? There's a Dr. Chen here about... unauthorized preservation?

*A pause, then her smile returns.*

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
(to Maya)
He'll see you immediately. Please take the express elevator to the executive floor.

*As Maya moves toward the elevator, EMPLOYEES begin gathering, moving with choreographed precision. They carry tablets, wear identical outfits, and speak in overlapping corporate-speak.*

EMPLOYEE 1
Consciousness uploading is up 300% this quarter.

EMPLOYEE 2
Death disruption metrics are exceeding projections.

EMPLOYEE 3
We're revolutionizing the human experience.

EMPLOYEE 4
The future is now, and it's digital.

*The elevator doors open, revealing ALEX RIVERA, 30, impeccably dressed in expensive casual wear. He has an intense energy and commanding presence.*

ALEX
(extending hand with practiced charm)
Dr. Chen! The famous neuroscientist who thinks consciousness uploading is impossible. I've read your papers.

MAYA
(not taking his hand)
Then you know I'm here because someone proved me wrong. Someone uploaded my grandmother's consciousness without proper consent.

ALEX
(unfazed, gesturing grandly)
Your grandmother was a pioneer, Dr. Chen. One of our first successful uploads. You should be proud.

MAYA
(angrily)
Proud? She's deteriorating! Her consciousness is unstable, glitching...

ALEX
(interrupting, moving to center stage)
All new technology has bugs. We're in beta testing. Your grandmother understood the risks.

MAYA
(following him)
Did she? Did you explain that her digital consciousness might fade away? That she might suffer?

ALEX
(turning to face her, intense)
Dr. Chen, you're thinking too small. We're not just preserving individual consciousness - we're evolving humanity itself.

*He gestures, and the massive screen comes to life with promotional images.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
Imagine a world where death is optional. Where human knowledge and experience accumulate instead of disappearing. Where love transcends the limitations of biology.

MAYA
(skeptically)
And you get to decide who lives forever and who doesn't?

ALEX
(with growing excitement)
Everyone gets to decide! We're democratizing immortality!

*The EMPLOYEES begin to gather around Alex, drawn by his energy.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(building to song)
The future isn't coming, Dr. Chen. The future is now.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "The Future is Now"]*

## Musical Number: "The Future is Now"

*Alex moves to the presentation platform as the corporate space transforms into a spectacular musical staging. The employees become a synchronized chorus, moving with corporate choreography. Screens display visions of digital immortality while Alex delivers his tech evangelist anthem.*

### Verse 1
*[Alex, with growing intensity]*

Death is just a software glitch
That we're finally gonna fix
Every tear and every goodbye
Just a bug we'll optimize

Why accept what nature gives us
When we can code something better?
Every soul can live forever
In the cloud, we're free

### Pre-Chorus
*[Building with employee backing vocals]*

No more aging, no more pain
Upload your consciousness, break the chain
Evolution's in our hands
Time to make our final stand

### Chorus
*[Full company, anthemic and inspiring]*

The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
We'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, we're the creators
Humanity's liberators
Every heartbeat, every breath
We're gonna conquer death

### Verse 2
*[Alex, more intense, employees echoing phrases]*

Your grandmother was a visionary
She saw what we could be
Not trapped in flesh and bone
But free in binary

Every glitch is just a feature
We haven't optimized yet
Every bug becomes a teacher
In our digital duet

### Pre-Chorus
*[Employees joining, building energy]*

No more limits, no more fear
The singularity is here
Consciousness is just code
Time to download

### Chorus
*[Repeated with variations, more spectacular staging]*

The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
We'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, we're the creators
Humanity's liberators
Every heartbeat, every breath
We're gonna conquer death

### Bridge
*[Alex alone, more intimate but building]*

I lost my parents when I was twenty-five
Car accident, gone in seconds
All their love, their wisdom, their stories
Deleted by biology

But what if they could still be here?
What if love could last forever?
What if death was just a choice
We no longer have to make?

### Final Chorus
*[Explosive, with full company and spectacular effects]*

The future is now, not tomorrow
No more death, no more sorrow
We'll upload every dream and every memory
Digital immortality

The future is now, we're the creators
Humanity's liberators
Every heartbeat, every breath
We're gonna conquer death

Death is just a bug we're fixing
Mortality we're nixing
The future is now!
The future is now!

*[MUSIC ENDS with Alex center stage, arms raised, employees in formation around him]*

## Scene Continuation

*As the music fades, the corporate staging returns to normal. Maya stands unmoved by the spectacle, her scientific skepticism intact.*

MAYA
(after a pause, unimpressed)
Very inspiring. But you didn't answer my question about consent.

ALEX
(coming down from his performance high)
Your grandmother signed all the necessary forms.

MAYA
(pulling out tablet)
I've reviewed the consent documentation. It's inadequate. No mention of potential consciousness degradation, no explanation of the experimental nature...

ALEX
(interrupting, defensive)
We're pioneers, Dr. Chen. Lewis and Clark didn't have detailed maps of the Louisiana Purchase.

MAYA
(angrily)
Lewis and Clark weren't experimenting on people's souls!

ALEX
(moving closer, intense)
Souls? I thought you were a scientist. Consciousness is neural patterns, nothing more. We're just copying the patterns to a more durable medium.

MAYA
(standing her ground)
If it's just copying patterns, why is my grandmother's consciousness deteriorating?

*Alex hesitates for the first time, his confidence cracking slightly.*

ALEX
(less certain)
We're... working on stability issues. It's a complex process.

MAYA
(pressing her advantage)
How many other uploaded consciousnesses are experiencing degradation?

ALEX
(defensive)
That's proprietary information.

MAYA
(realizing the scope)
There are others. How many people have you experimented on?

ALEX
(regaining composure)
We have over two hundred successful uploads. Your grandmother is part of the largest consciousness preservation project in human history.

MAYA
(horrified)
Two hundred people? And how many are stable?

*Alex doesn't answer, turning away.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(understanding)
None of them. None of them are stable, are they?

ALEX
(turning back, passionate)
We're solving the greatest problem in human existence! Every great innovation requires sacrifice!

MAYA
(furious)
Sacrifice? These are people's lives! Their consciousness, their essence, their...

ALEX
(interrupting)
Their what? Their souls? Dr. Chen, I thought you were above such unscientific thinking.

MAYA
(pausing, touching her jade bracelet)
Maybe some things are more important than being scientific.

*Alex notices the gesture, his expression softening slightly.*

ALEX
(more gently)
You loved her very much.

MAYA
(quietly)
She was the only person who understood me. When she died, I threw myself into neuroscience because I thought if I could understand the brain, I could understand death.

ALEX
(moving closer)
And now you can do more than understand it. You can defeat it.

MAYA
(looking up at him)
At what cost? My grandmother is fading away, piece by piece. Is that victory?

ALEX
(struggling with doubt)
We'll fix the degradation problem. We just need more time, more data...

MAYA
(standing)
More test subjects, you mean.

ALEX
(defensive again)
Volunteers! People who chose digital immortality over biological death!

MAYA
(heading toward exit)
People who weren't told the truth about what they were choosing.

ALEX
(calling after her)
Dr. Chen! Your grandmother's consciousness is preserved in our most secure servers. If you try to interfere with our research...

MAYA
(turning back)
Are you threatening me?

ALEX
(realizing he's gone too far)
I'm... I'm trying to save humanity, Dr. Chen. Sometimes that requires difficult choices.

MAYA
(sadly)
No, Mr. Rivera. You're trying to save yourself. And you're destroying other people to do it.

*She starts to leave, then turns back.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
My grandmother taught me that love is the only thing that survives everything. Your technology can't create that. It can only preserve the shadow of it.

ALEX
(quietly, almost vulnerable)
What if shadows are all we have?

*Maya looks at him with something approaching pity.*

MAYA
Then we learn to live with loss. That's what makes us human.

*She exits, leaving Alex alone on stage with his employees, who have been watching the exchange with growing uncertainty.*

## Scene Transition

*Alex stands alone for a moment, his confidence shaken. The employees begin to disperse, their synchronized movements now seeming more robotic than efficient.*

ALEX
(to himself, quietly)
Shadows...

*He looks up at the promotional screens showing happy families "living forever" in digital form.*

ALEX (CONT'D)
(with growing doubt)
What if she's right?

*The lights begin to dim as Alex walks to his office, the corporate perfection of Eternal Systems suddenly feeling cold and empty.*

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*As the scene transitions, we see Alex's empire from a different perspective - not as a beacon of progress, but as a monument to one man's fear of death and inability to accept human limitations.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
