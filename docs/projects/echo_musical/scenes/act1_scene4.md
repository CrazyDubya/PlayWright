## Setting Description

*The stage transforms into a formal academic conference room. A large oval table dominates the center, surrounded by leather chairs. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the walls, filled with volumes on ethics, philosophy, and biomedical research.*

*A large screen at one end displays the Stanford University seal and "Committee on Research Ethics." The lighting is warm but serious, suggesting the weight of institutional authority and academic tradition.*

*Committee members - professors from various disciplines - sit around the table with papers, laptops, and coffee cups. The atmosphere is one of serious academic discourse.*

## Scene Opening

*MAYA sits at one end of the table, facing the ETHICS COMMITTEE. DR. JAMES WRIGHT, 55, distinguished with gray hair and wire-rimmed glasses, chairs the meeting from the head of the table.*

DR. WRIGHT
(calling meeting to order)
This emergency session of the Committee on Research Ethics is now in session. Dr. Chen has requested urgent review of consciousness uploading research conducted by Eternal Systems Corporation.

*He looks at Maya with paternal concern.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
Maya, you've been my student for three years. I've never seen you this... unsettled. What's happened?

MAYA
(taking a breath)
Dr. Wright, committee members, I've discovered that Eternal Systems has been conducting unauthorized human consciousness uploading experiments. My grandmother's consciousness was preserved without proper informed consent.

*Murmurs around the table. COMMITTEE MEMBERS lean forward with interest.*

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1 (DR. PATEL)
(skeptically)
Consciousness uploading? That's still theoretical at best.

MAYA
(firmly)
I've communicated with my grandmother's digital consciousness. The technology exists, but it's fundamentally flawed. The uploaded consciousnesses are degrading.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 2 (DR. MARTINEZ)
(concerned)
How many subjects are we talking about?

MAYA
(grimly)
Over two hundred people. All experiencing various forms of digital deterioration.

*Shocked silence around the table.*

DR. WRIGHT
(gravely)
Maya, these are extraordinary claims. Do you have evidence?

MAYA
(pulling out tablet)
I have the consciousness preservation files, communication logs with my grandmother's digital form, and documentation of the consent process - which is completely inadequate.

*She activates her tablet, and Digital Nai Nai's voice fills the room.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (V.O.)
(slightly distorted)
Hello, little treasure. I hope these people can help us.

*The committee members exchange startled glances.*

COMMITTEE MEMBER 3 (DR. JOHNSON)
(amazed)
That's... that's actually a preserved human consciousness?

MAYA
(sadly)
What's left of one. She's fading, Dr. Johnson. Piece by piece, memory by memory.

DR. WRIGHT
(standing, moving around table)
Maya, I need you to understand the implications of what you're telling us. If Eternal Systems is conducting unauthorized human experimentation...

MAYA
(interrupting)
They are. And they're covering it up with corporate marketing about "digital immortality."

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1 (DR. PATEL)
(practical)
What exactly are you asking this committee to do?

MAYA
(standing, passionate)
I'm asking you to investigate. To demand transparency. To protect the people who trusted Eternal Systems with their consciousness.

DR. WRIGHT
(thoughtfully)
This isn't just about research ethics anymore. This is about the fundamental nature of human consciousness and our responsibility to protect it.

*He moves to center stage, his academic demeanor shifting to something more urgent.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(building intensity)
We've seen this before. New technology, revolutionary promises, inadequate oversight...

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "The Pandora Protocol"]*

## Musical Number: "The Pandora Protocol"

*Dr. Wright moves to center stage as the conference room lighting shifts to something more dramatic. The committee members become a chorus, representing the academic and scientific community grappling with dangerous technology.*

### Verse 1
*[Dr. Wright, with growing intensity]*

Every generation thinks they've found the key
To unlock the secrets that were meant to be
Hidden in the darkness, locked away from sight
But some doors shouldn't be opened to the light

We split the atom, thought we'd found the sun
Then Hiroshima showed us what we'd done
We mapped the genome, thought we'd conquered death
Then learned that playing God can steal our breath

### Pre-Chorus
*[Committee members joining, building tension]*

History teaches us, but we never learn
Every bridge we build, we're bound to burn
Every box we open, every line we cross
Brings us closer to catastrophic loss

### Chorus
*[Full ensemble, warning and urgent]*

It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

When you think you're saving lives
But you're cutting them with knives
Made of good intentions and pride
Some knowledge comes too dear
Some progress breeds only fear
It's the Pandora Protocol

### Verse 2
*[Dr. Wright, more personal and intense]*

I've spent my life watching brilliant minds
Ignore the warnings, cross the warning signs
"We'll be careful," that's what they all say
"We'll control it," then it breaks away

Nuclear power, genetic engineering
Internet surveillance, consciousness transferring
Every breakthrough brings a brand new threat
To the humanity we're trying to protect

### Pre-Chorus
*[Building with committee, more urgent]*

History teaches us, but we refuse to see
That every chain we break just makes us less free
Every god we try to play, every rule we break
Brings us closer to our final mistake

### Chorus
*[Repeated with more intensity]*

It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

When you think you're saving lives
But you're cutting them with knives
Made of good intentions and pride
Some knowledge comes too dear
Some progress breeds only fear
It's the Pandora Protocol

### Bridge
*[Dr. Wright alone, vulnerable]*

My parents survived the camps in Germany
Where doctors thought they were advancing humanity
They told me stories of experiments done
In the name of science, in the name of progress
In the name of helping everyone

But help that comes without consent
Is just another form of violence
And progress built on others' pain
Is just sophisticated madness

### Final Chorus
*[Explosive, with full committee and projections of historical disasters]*

It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

Maya, what you've found today
Could be the price we'll have to pay
For thinking we could play with souls
Some boxes must stay closed
Some secrets unexposed
It's the Pandora Protocol

*[MUSIC ENDS with Dr. Wright center stage, the committee sobered by the weight of history]*

## Scene Continuation

*As the music fades, the conference room returns to normal lighting. The committee members sit in contemplative silence.*

MAYA
(quietly)
Dr. Wright, I understand the risks. But my grandmother and two hundred other people are already trapped in Eternal Systems' servers. We can't close this box - it's already open.

DR. WRIGHT
(sitting heavily)
Then we have to deal with the consequences. Maya, what do you need from us?

MAYA
(determined)
Official university investigation. Demand access to Eternal Systems' research data. Public hearings on consciousness uploading ethics.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 2 (DR. MARTINEZ)
(concerned)
That's a significant escalation. We'd be taking on a major corporation.

MAYA
(firmly)
They're experimenting on human consciousness without proper oversight. If we don't act, who will?

DR. WRIGHT
(standing, decisive)
Maya's right. This committee exists to protect human subjects in research. These people trusted Eternal Systems with their very essence.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1 (DR. PATEL)
(practical)
What about legal implications? Corporate pushback?

DR. WRIGHT
(with authority)
Let me worry about the politics. Our job is to determine what's ethical, not what's convenient.

*He looks around the table at his colleagues.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
All in favor of launching a formal investigation into Eternal Systems' consciousness uploading research?

*Hands raise around the table - unanimous.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(to Maya)
You have the full backing of this committee. But Maya...

*He moves closer, paternal concern evident.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
Be careful. When you challenge powerful interests, they tend to challenge back.

MAYA
(touching her jade bracelet)
My grandmother didn't get to be careful. She trusted them with her consciousness, and they're letting her fade away.

DR. WRIGHT
(softly)
Then we won't let her fade in vain.

*Maya nods, grateful for the support.*

MAYA
There's something else. I think I need to talk to other families, other people whose loved ones were uploaded. They deserve to know the truth.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 3 (DR. JOHNSON)
(concerned)
That could be dangerous, Maya. If Eternal Systems is covering this up...

MAYA
(standing)
Then it's even more important that people know. Dr. Wright, can the university provide protection for whistleblowers?

DR. WRIGHT
(firmly)
Absolutely. Academic freedom includes the right to expose unethical research.

*Maya gathers her materials, energized by the institutional support.*

MAYA
Thank you. All of you. My grandmother always said that some fights are worth having, even if you're not sure you can win.

DR. WRIGHT
(smiling slightly)
She sounds like a wise woman.

MAYA
(sadly)
She was. And if there's any way to save what's left of her wisdom, I have to try.

## Scene Transition

*As Maya heads toward the exit, Dr. Wright calls after her.*

DR. WRIGHT
Maya, one more thing. You mentioned your friend Zara Okafor - the digital rights activist?

MAYA
(turning back)
Yes?

DR. WRIGHT
You might want to bring her into this. If we're going to take on Eternal Systems, we'll need someone who understands how to fight corporate power.

MAYA
(realizing)
A coalition. Academic ethics, digital rights activism, and scientific evidence.

DR. WRIGHT
(nodding)
Sometimes the only way to stop a Pandora's Box is to build a bigger one.

*Maya smiles for the first time in the scene.*

MAYA
Nai Nai would like that. She always said the best way to fix a broken pattern is to weave a stronger one around it.

*She exits, leaving Dr. Wright and the committee to contemplate the magnitude of what they've just committed to.*

DR. WRIGHT
(to committee, quietly)
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're about to find out whether academic ethics can stand up to Silicon Valley billions.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1 (DR. PATEL)
(grimly)
History suggests it's an uphill battle.

DR. WRIGHT
(with determination)
Then we'd better start climbing.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The lights dim on the conference room as the committee members gather their materials, each understanding that they've just committed to a fight that will test everything they believe about ethics, technology, and human dignity.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
