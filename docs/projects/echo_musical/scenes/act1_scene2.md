## Setting Description

*The laboratory is dimmer now, lit only by the glow of screens and equipment. Empty coffee cups and scattered printouts show Maya has been working all night. The main projection screen displays streams of data, but something is different - the code patterns are more organic, almost like living tissue.*

*Maya sits hunched over her workstation, exhausted but determined. Her hair has escaped its bun, and she's removed her lab coat. The jade bracelet catches the light as she types.*

## Scene Opening

*MAYA stares at the screen, rubbing her tired eyes. The computer has been running traces all night.*

MAYA
(to computer, weary)
Computer, status report on file trace.

COMPUTER VOICE
Trace complete. Files originated from Eternal Systems Corporation, San Francisco. Quantum encryption suggests experimental consciousness preservation technology.

*Maya sits up straighter, suddenly alert.*

MAYA
Eternal Systems? That's Alex Rivera's company. The consciousness uploading startup.

*She pulls up information about Eternal Systems - corporate data, news articles, research papers.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(reading)
"Revolutionary breakthrough in digital consciousness preservation..." "First successful human upload..." 

*She pauses, her scientific skepticism warring with the evidence.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to herself)
This is impossible. Consciousness can't be digitized. It's not a file you can copy and paste.

*She returns to the mysterious data files, hesitating before opening them.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(whispered)
But if it's not real... how did she know my childhood nickname?

*She touches the jade bracelet, then reaches out to open the files. As her finger contacts the screen, the laboratory lighting shifts from cool blue to warm golden.*

*The data streams reorganize themselves, forming patterns that look almost like neural networks, but more complex, more alive.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(amazed)
What the hell...?

*Suddenly, the patterns coalesce into a figure - translucent, shimmering, but unmistakably human. DIGITAL NAI NAI materializes center stage, wearing a traditional blue qipao that occasionally pixelates at the edges.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(warm, loving, with slight electronic undertone)
Hello, xiao bao. You look tired.

*Maya stumbles backward, knocking over her coffee cup.*

MAYA
(panicked)
This isn't real. This is some kind of... of holographic projection. A trick.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(moving closer, but her feet don't quite touch the ground)
Touch my hand, little treasure.

*Maya reaches out instinctively, but her hand passes through Digital Nai Nai's. Both women look at the space between them with sadness.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
(sadly)
I cannot touch you anymore. But I am still here.

MAYA
(voice breaking)
Nai Nai died thirteen years ago. I held her hand in the hospital. I watched them... I watched them turn off the machines.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(gently)
Yes, my body died. But three days before, when you were at school, some people came to see me. They said they could preserve my mind, my memories, my love for you.

*Maya shakes her head, backing away.*

MAYA
No. Consciousness uploading is theoretical at best. The technology doesn't exist.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(with a slight smile)
You always were too smart for your own good. Just like your mother.

*She moves around the laboratory, examining the equipment with curiosity.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
I don't understand all these machines, but I understand love. And love finds a way.

MAYA
(desperate)
Show me proof. Scientific proof. Brain scans, neural mapping data, something I can measure.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(laughing softly)
Still asking for data points, I see.

*Maya freezes - those were the exact words from her song.*

MAYA
How did you...? You weren't here when I...

DIGITAL NAI NAI
I am everywhere in this system now, xiao bao. I heard your song. Very impressive, but you're missing something important.

MAYA
(defensively)
I'm not missing anything. Consciousness is neural activity. When the brain dies, consciousness ends. That's science.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(moving closer)
And what about love? Can you measure love with your machines?

MAYA
Love is oxytocin, dopamine, neural reward pathways...

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(interrupting gently)
Can you weigh a memory? Can you hold a dream in your hands?

*Maya struggles for an answer.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
Some things exist beyond your measurements, little treasure. Some things are real even when you cannot prove them.

*The lighting shifts as Digital Nai Nai moves to center stage.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
Let me show you who I am.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "Threads of Memory"]*

## Musical Number: "Threads of Memory"

*As Digital Nai Nai sings, the laboratory transforms. Projections show memories: a young woman sewing by candlelight, teaching a little girl to braid her hair, cooking traditional dishes, telling stories.*

*Maya watches, transfixed, as her grandmother's life unfolds in song and image. During the bridge, when Digital Nai Nai sings about braiding hair and lullabies, Maya unconsciously touches her own hair and hums along with a half-remembered melody.*

*The song builds to an emotional climax as Digital Nai Nai reaches toward Maya, their hands almost touching but never quite making contact.*

*As the song ends, the projections fade, leaving just the two women in the golden light.*

## Scene Continuation

*[MUSIC ENDS]*

*Maya stands motionless, tears streaming down her face.*

MAYA
(whispered)
I remember that lullaby. You used to sing it when I had nightmares.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(softly)
"Xiao bao, xiao bao, close your eyes. Nai Nai will chase the monsters away."

MAYA
(breaking down)
I missed you so much. After you died, I threw myself into science because it was the only thing that made sense. But nothing made sense without you.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(lovingly)
I never left you, little treasure. I was always here.

*She gestures to Maya's heart.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
But now I can speak to you again, teach you the things I never had time to share.

MAYA
(wiping her eyes)
How is this possible? How are you here?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
The people from Eternal Systems, they explained it to me. They said they could capture the patterns of my mind, preserve my memories and personality in their computers.

MAYA
(scientist returning)
But consciousness isn't just memories. It's the dynamic process of thinking, feeling, experiencing...

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(interrupting with a glitch - her image flickers)
I am... experiencing... this conversation... with you...

*Her voice becomes slightly electronic, then returns to normal.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
(concerned)
But something is wrong. I can feel myself... fading sometimes. Like a tapestry coming apart.

MAYA
(alarmed)
Fading? What do you mean?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
The young man, Alex, he promised I would be preserved forever. But I think there are... problems with their technology.

*She flickers again, more severely this time.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
(urgently)
That's why I had to reach you now. I have so much to tell you, so much to teach you. The recipes your mother never learned, the stories of our family, the wisdom passed down through generations.

MAYA
(determined)
Then we'll fix it. I'll figure out what's wrong with their system. I'll stabilize your consciousness.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(sadly)
Can you fix death, little treasure?

MAYA
(fiercely)
I can try. I'm not losing you again.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(touching her heart, though her hand passes through)
You never lost me. But if you want to help, you must learn who you are. Not just the scientist, but the granddaughter. Not just the American, but the Chinese. Not just the mind, but the heart.

*Maya nods, wiping away fresh tears.*

MAYA
Teach me, Nai Nai. Teach me everything.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(smiling)
We start with the most important lesson: how to make proper dumplings. Your technique is terrible.

*Maya laughs despite her tears.*

MAYA
How do you know about my dumpling technique?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(winking)
I have been watching, little treasure. The internet sees everything.

*They both laugh, and for a moment, the impossibility of the situation fades into the simple joy of family connection.*

MAYA
Nai Nai, I need to ask you something important. Did you choose this? To be uploaded?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(seriously)
Yes. When the doctors said I had only days left, and you were so busy with your studies... I wanted to find a way to stay with you, to guide you when you needed me.

MAYA
But the ethics of it... the consent process... did they explain the risks?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(flickering slightly)
They said I would live forever in their computers. They did not mention I might fade away like old photographs.

*Maya's expression hardens.*

MAYA
Alex Rivera has some explaining to do.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(warning)
Be careful, xiao bao. He is not evil, but he is young and believes too much in his machines. Sometimes the heart sees what the mind cannot.

*The laboratory lights flicker, and Digital Nai Nai's image becomes unstable.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (CONT'D)
(fading)
I must go now. The connection is... difficult to maintain.

MAYA
(reaching out)
Wait! When will I see you again?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(voice becoming distant)
Tomorrow night. Same time. I will teach you to make wontons properly.

*Her image pixelates and fades, leaving only her voice.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (V.O.)
(fading)
Remember, little treasure... love is the only thing that survives everything... even death...

*The laboratory returns to its normal cool lighting. Maya stands alone, staring at the empty space where her grandmother appeared.*

## Scene Transition

*Maya slowly returns to her workstation, but everything has changed. She's no longer the skeptical scientist who opened the scene. She pulls up information about Eternal Systems, but now her research has a personal urgency.*

MAYA
(to herself, determined)
Alex Rivera, you and I need to have a conversation.

*She begins typing rapidly, her scientific training now focused on understanding and protecting her grandmother's digital existence.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to computer)
Computer, compile everything we have on consciousness uploading technology. I want to know exactly how this works and what could go wrong.

COMPUTER VOICE
Compiling data. Warning: most research is classified or proprietary.

MAYA
(grimly)
Then we'll have to go to the source.

*She picks up her phone and dials.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Zara? I know it's early, but I need your help. Remember that activist thing you do? Well, I think I found a cause worth fighting for.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*As Maya talks on the phone, the lights shift to suggest the passage of time. The scene transitions toward Maya's decision to confront Eternal Systems directly.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
