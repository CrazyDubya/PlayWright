## Setting Description

*The stage is dominated by a sleek, futuristic laboratory. Multiple holographic displays float in mid-air, showing rotating brain scans, neural pathway maps, and streams of data. Center stage is Maya's workstation - a curved desk with multiple screens and haptic interfaces. The lab extends into the wings, suggesting a larger research facility.*

*Upstage, a large transparent screen serves as the main projection surface. Laboratory equipment - some recognizable, some fantastical - fills the space. Everything is bathed in cool blue-white light, giving the impression of a space where science reigns supreme.*

*The only warm element is a small personal area stage left: a chair with Maya's jacket, a coffee mug, and prominently displayed on the desk, a jade bracelet.*

## Scene Opening

*Lights up on MAYA CHEN, 28, working intently at her station. She wears a lab coat over jeans and a vintage band t-shirt. Her hair is pulled back in a messy bun. Multiple holographic displays surround her, showing brain scans and neural network diagrams.*

*She manipulates the displays with precise hand gestures, zooming in on specific neural pathways. The projections respond to her movements like a conductor leading an orchestra of data.*

MAYA
(to herself, studying a brain scan)
Come on... show me what you're hiding.

*She swipes left, bringing up a new display - a real-time neural activity map.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
Consciousness uploading. Digital immortality. 
(scoffs)
The biggest scam in Silicon Valley, and that's saying something.

*She touches a control surface, and the displays reorganize themselves around her.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
Every thought, every memory, every feeling - it's all just neurons firing in patterns. Beautiful, complex patterns, but patterns nonetheless.

*She pauses, her hand unconsciously moving to touch the jade bracelet on her wrist.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(softer, more vulnerable)
Nǎi Nai used to say the heart remembers what the mind forgets. But the heart is just a muscle, and memory is just... 

*She catches herself getting emotional and returns to the data.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(firmly, back to science)
Memory is just protein synthesis and synaptic strengthening. That's it.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring]*

*The laboratory lighting shifts subtly as Maya moves away from her workstation, the music building.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(speaking rhythmically, building to song)
Every mystery has an explanation. Every question has an answer. You just have to know where to look.

*[SONG: "Data Points" begins]*

## Musical Number: "Data Points"

*During the song, Maya moves through her laboratory, interacting with the technology around her. The holographic displays respond to the music, creating visual representations of her lyrics. Brain scans pulse in rhythm, data streams flow like rivers of light, and neural networks bloom and contract like digital flowers.*

*As she sings about consciousness being "just computation," the displays show increasingly complex neural patterns. During the bridge - her moment of vulnerability - the lighting warms slightly, and she touches her grandmother's jade bracelet.*

*The song builds to a powerful finish with Maya center stage, surrounded by swirling data projections, declaring her scientific manifesto. But in the final moments, there's a hint of uncertainty in her voice, a crack in her certainty.*

## Scene Continuation

*[MUSIC ENDS]*

*Maya returns to her workstation, energized by her declaration but also slightly unsettled. She sits down and pulls up a new file.*

MAYA
(to computer)
Computer, open Project Consciousness files.

COMPUTER VOICE
(synthesized, neutral)
Opening Project Consciousness. You have forty-seven new data packets.

MAYA
Forty-seven? I was only expecting the Stanford cohort results.

*She gestures, and the new files appear as floating icons around her.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
Computer, identify source of additional data packets.

COMPUTER VOICE
Source unknown. Files are encrypted with quantum-level security. Attempting to decode.

*Maya frowns, leaning forward with interest.*

MAYA
Unknown source? That's impossible. This is a closed research network.

*She reaches out to touch one of the mysterious file icons. As her finger makes contact, the icon pulses with warm, golden light - completely different from the cool blue of her laboratory.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(surprised)
What the hell?

*The file begins to open on its own, revealing not scientific data, but something else entirely - fragments of memory, pieces of a life lived.*

*On the main screen, images begin to appear: a young woman sewing by candlelight, hands working with needle and thread, creating intricate patterns. The images are soft, warm, tinged with sepia tones that contrast sharply with the laboratory's sterile environment.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(whispered, recognizing something)
No. That's not possible.

*She stands, moving closer to the screen. The images continue: the same woman, now older, teaching a young girl to sew. The girl looks remarkably like a young Maya.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
Nǎi Nai?

*The laboratory lights flicker. The cool blue gives way to warm golden tones. And then, impossibly, a voice - elderly, kind, speaking with a slight Chinese accent.*

DIGITAL NǍI NAI (V.O.)
(from the speakers, distant but clear)
Xiǎo bǎo... my little treasure. You've grown so tall.

*Maya stumbles backward, her scientific worldview crashing against impossible reality.*

MAYA
(to herself, panicked)
This isn't real. This is some kind of... of simulation. A hoax.

DIGITAL NǍI NAI (V.O.)
(warmer, more present)
Still so stubborn, just like your mother. Always needing proof for everything.

*Maya's hands shake as she reaches for her tablet, trying to run diagnostics.*

MAYA
Computer, run full system diagnostic. Check for external intrusion, malware, any—

DIGITAL NǍI NAI (V.O.)
(interrupting, with gentle humor)
Xiǎo bǎo, stop talking to that machine and talk to your Nǎi Nai.

*Maya freezes. The voice is exactly as she remembers - warm, loving, with that particular way of pronouncing her childhood nickname.*

MAYA
(whispered)
You died. Thirteen years ago. I was at your funeral.

DIGITAL NǍI NAI (V.O.)
(sadly)
Yes, my body died. But I am still here, still with you. Just... different now.

*The images on screen shift, showing the woman - Nǎi Nai - in her final years, lying in a hospital bed but smiling, holding Maya's hand.*

DIGITAL NǍI NAI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I have so much to tell you, xiǎo bǎo. So much you never learned. But first...

*The voice becomes urgent, concerned.*

DIGITAL NǍI NAI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
First, you must understand - I am running out of time.

## Scene Transition

*The laboratory lights flicker again, and for a moment, the warm golden glow fades back to sterile blue. The images on screen pixelate and distort.*

MAYA
(reaching toward the screen)
Nǎi Nai, wait! Don't go!

*But the connection is lost. The screen returns to normal data displays. The laboratory is once again cold and scientific.*

*Maya stands alone, staring at the screen, her hand still outstretched. She looks down at the jade bracelet on her wrist - the only physical connection she has left to her grandmother.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to herself, shaken)
What the hell just happened?

*She moves back to her workstation, pulling up the mysterious files again. This time, she approaches them not as a skeptical scientist, but as a granddaughter desperate for answers.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(determined)
Computer, trace the source of these files. I don't care how long it takes or how many firewalls you have to break through. Find out where they came from.

COMPUTER VOICE
Beginning trace. Estimated completion time: six hours.

*Maya looks at the clock - 11:47 PM.*

MAYA
(to herself)
Looks like it's going to be a long night.

*She settles in at her workstation, but her eyes keep drifting to the main screen, hoping for another glimpse of golden light, another impossible conversation with the grandmother she thought she'd lost forever.*

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*Lights fade on Maya as she works, the laboratory returning to its cool, scientific glow. But now there's something different in the air - a sense that the impossible has become possible, that the boundaries between science and mystery are not as clear as Maya believed.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
