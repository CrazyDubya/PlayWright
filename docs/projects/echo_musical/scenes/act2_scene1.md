## Setting Description

*The stage is split between two locations. Stage left shows the plaza outside Eternal Systems headquarters - a corporate space with glass buildings and sterile landscaping. Stage right shows Maya's laboratory, now transformed into a command center with multiple screens, research materials, and family photos of upload victims.*

*The contrast is stark: corporate power vs. grassroots resistance, cold technology vs. human stories.*

## Scene Opening - Outside Eternal Systems

*Lights up on ZARA OKAFOR, 26, dynamic and passionate, setting up protest equipment with a diverse group of ACTIVISTS. They carry signs reading "Digital Rights Are Human Rights," "Consciousness Is Not Code," and "Where Are Our Loved Ones?"*

ZARA
(to protesters, energized)
Remember, we're not just protesting a company - we're fighting for the souls of our families and friends. Eternal Systems thinks they can hide behind corporate speak and marketing buzzwords.

PROTESTER 1
(holding sign with photo)
My father's been uploaded for six months. They won't let me talk to him.

PROTESTER 2
(emotional)
My wife is glitching. She doesn't remember our anniversary anymore.

ZARA
(moving among them, building energy)
That's exactly why we're here. They promised digital immortality, but they delivered digital imprisonment.

*She climbs onto a makeshift platform, megaphone in hand.*

ZARA (CONT'D)
(to growing crowd)
For too long, tech companies have treated us like products to be optimized instead of people to be respected. They harvest our data, manipulate our emotions, and now they want to own our consciousness itself!

*The crowd responds with energy. SECURITY GUARDS appear at the building entrance.*

ZARA (CONT'D)
(building to song)
But we're not data points. We're not user metrics. We're human beings, and it's time to delete the elite who think they own us!

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "Delete the Elite"]*

## Musical Number: "Delete the Elite"

*The protest transforms into a spectacular musical number. Zara leads from the platform while protesters become a choreographed ensemble. The corporate building serves as backdrop for projections showing corporate malfeasance.*

### Verse 1
*[Zara, with growing intensity]*

They built their towers on our broken dreams
Sold us promises and pyramid schemes
"Upload your soul, live forever," they said
While counting the profits from our digital dead

They think we're stupid, think we'll just comply
While our families fade and our loved ones die
But we've got news for the corporate machine
We're gonna delete you from the scene

### Pre-Chorus
*[Protesters joining, building energy]*

No more lies, no more spin
No more letting greed win
Time to fight, time to rise
Time to see through their disguise

### Chorus
*[Full ensemble, powerful and anthemic]*

Delete the elite, delete the greed
Delete the lies that make us bleed
Delete the code that steals our souls
Delete the system that's out of control

We're not your products, we're not your slaves
We're not the data that your algorithm craves
Delete the elite, delete the lies
Time for the people to rise, rise, rise!

### Verse 2
*[Zara, more intense, protesters echoing]*

They promised heaven but delivered hell
Trapped our consciousness in a corporate cell
Two hundred families, two hundred souls
Locked away while the profit rolls

But we're not backing down, we're not going away
We'll be here tomorrow and every day
Until you open up those server doors
And give us back what you stole from us before

### Pre-Chorus
*[Building with full ensemble]*

No more lies, no more spin
No more letting greed win
Time to fight, time to rise
Time to see through their disguise

### Chorus
*[Repeated with more intensity and choreography]*

Delete the elite, delete the greed
Delete the lies that make us bleed
Delete the code that steals our souls
Delete the system that's out of control

We're not your products, we're not your slaves
We're not the data that your algorithm craves
Delete the elite, delete the lies
Time for the people to rise, rise, rise!

### Bridge
*[Zara alone, more personal]*

My father came here with nothing but hope
Built a life, learned to cope
Then a tech company threw him away
Like yesterday's code, obsolete today

But his daughter learned to fight
Learned to code, learned to write
Learned to use their own tools
To expose them as fools

### Final Chorus
*[Explosive, with full company and spectacular staging]*

Delete the elite, delete the greed
Delete the lies that make us bleed
Delete the code that steals our souls
Delete the system that's out of control

We're not your products, we're not your slaves
We're not the data that your algorithm craves
Delete the elite, delete the lies
Time for the people to rise!

ZARA (final solo):
Time for the people to rise!

*[MUSIC ENDS with Zara center stage, protesters in formation, corporate building looming behind them]*

## Scene Transition - Maya's Laboratory

*As the protest music fades, lights shift to Maya's lab. She's surrounded by screens showing uploaded consciousness files, family photos, and degradation patterns.*

MAYA
(to Digital Nai Nai, who appears on main screen)
Nai Nai, look at this. I've been tracking the degradation patterns across all the uploaded consciousnesses.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(appearing more pixelated than before)
What have you found, xiao bao?

MAYA
(pulling up data)
It's not random. The emotional memories are being systematically deleted to free up processing power. Eternal Systems is literally erasing love to save money.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(sadly)
So we become shadows of ourselves, keeping only the facts but losing the feelings.

MAYA
(angrily)
It's monstrous. They're turning human consciousness into efficient data storage.

*She pulls up another screen showing Zara's protest.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
At least Zara's making sure the world knows what's happening.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(watching the protest)
She's very brave, your friend. And very angry.

MAYA
(concerned)
Maybe too angry. I'm worried she's going to get herself arrested.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(wisely)
Sometimes anger is the only appropriate response to injustice. But anger without strategy is just noise.

*Maya's phone buzzes with news alerts.*

MAYA
(reading)
"Protesters Disrupt Eternal Systems Operations." "Digital Rights Activists Demand Transparency." "Stock Price Falls on Consciousness Upload Controversy."

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(pleased)
Your friend is making an impact.

MAYA
(worried)
I hope she's being careful. Alex Rivera doesn't seem like the type to take public pressure well.

*As if summoned by her words, news footage appears on one of Maya's screens showing ALEX RIVERA giving a press conference outside Eternal Systems.*

## Scene Continuation - Alex's Response

*On screen, ALEX appears at a podium, looking polished but slightly strained.*

ALEX (ON SCREEN)
(to reporters)
The protesters outside our building today represent a fundamental misunderstanding of our technology. Eternal Systems is pioneering the greatest advancement in human history - the defeat of death itself.

REPORTER (V.O.)
Mr. Rivera, what do you say to families who claim their uploaded loved ones are deteriorating?

ALEX (ON SCREEN)
(defensive)
All new technology has growing pains. We're continuously improving our consciousness preservation algorithms. These protesters are fear-mongering about a process they don't understand.

*Maya turns up the volume, studying Alex's body language.*

MAYA
(to Digital Nai Nai)
He's lying. Look at his eyes - he knows the system is failing.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(observing)
He's afraid, xiao bao. Afraid of being wrong, afraid of being exposed.

ALEX (ON SCREEN, CONT'D)
(more agitated)
Dr. Maya Chen, who is leading this misguided campaign, is a failed researcher whose own theories about consciousness have been repeatedly debunked. She's using her grandmother's upload as a publicity stunt.

*Maya stands up, furious.*

MAYA
(to screen)
How dare you!

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(calmly)
He's trying to make you angry, little treasure. Angry people make mistakes.

ALEX (ON SCREEN, CONT'D)
Eternal Systems will not be intimidated by a handful of protesters who want to deny humanity the gift of immortality. We will continue our vital work regardless of this harassment.

*The press conference ends. Maya turns off the screen.*

MAYA
(determined)
He just made this personal.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(warning)
Maya, be careful. When powerful people feel cornered, they become dangerous.

MAYA
(pulling up more files)
Then we'd better make sure we have enough evidence to corner him completely.

*She discovers a new file - internal Eternal Systems communications.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(reading, shocked)
Nai Nai, look at this. Internal emails about "acceptable degradation rates" and "cost-effective consciousness compression."

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(sadly)
They knew. They knew we would fade, and they did it anyway.

MAYA
(grimly)
This is it. This is what we need to bring them down.

*Her phone rings - it's Zara.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(answering)
Zara, I saw the protest on the news. Are you okay?

ZARA (V.O.)
(energized)
Better than okay. We got their attention. But Maya, Alex Rivera just declared war on us in that press conference.

MAYA
I know. But I think I found our smoking gun.

ZARA (V.O.)
What do you mean?

MAYA
(looking at Digital Nai Nai)
Internal documents proving they knew about the degradation from the beginning. Zara, we can destroy them.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(concerned)
And they can destroy you, little treasure. Be very careful.

## Scene Transition

*As Maya and Zara plan their next move, the lights begin to shift, suggesting the escalating battle between the coalition and Eternal Systems.*

MAYA
(to Digital Nai Nai)
Nai Nai, are you ready for this to get ugly?

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(with a slight smile, despite her pixelation)
Xiao bao, I've been dead for thirteen years and trapped in a computer for six months. I think I can handle a little corporate warfare.

*Maya laughs despite the tension.*

MAYA
I love you, Nai Nai.

DIGITAL NAI NAI
(fading slightly)
And I love you, little treasure. Now go fight for all of us.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The scene transitions as Maya gathers her evidence and Zara mobilizes her protesters, the battle lines clearly drawn between grassroots coalition and corporate power.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*
