# ACT I, SCENE 4: The Ethics Committee (REVISED)

## Scene Header
- **Act**: I
- **Scene Number**: 4
- **Title**: "The Pandora Protocol" (Revised)
- **Location**: Stanford University Ethics Committee Conference Room
- **Time**: That afternoon (2:00 PM)
- **Characters Present**: Maya Chen, Dr. James Wright (REVISED), Ethics Committee Members

## Revision Goals
- **Humanize Dr. Wright** - Add personal failure, family estrangement, hidden illness
- **Break wise mentor stereotype** - Make him contradictory, flawed, struggling
- **Add specific Jewish background** - Holocaust family history, cultural guilt, generational trauma
- **Complicate his moral authority** - Past mistakes that inform current wisdom
- **Make terminal illness secret** - Hidden vulnerability affecting his urgency

## Setting Description (REVISED)

*The ethics committee conference room, but now we notice details that reveal Dr. Wright's personal struggles: prescription bottles quickly hidden in his briefcase, family photos turned face-down, a small mezuzah on his keychain that he touches nervously, and books on terminal illness mixed with ethics texts.*

*The formal academic setting contrasts with the personal chaos barely contained beneath the surface.*

## Scene Opening (REVISED)

*DR. JAMES WRIGHT, 55, sits at the head of the table, but he looks older than his years. His hands shake slightly as he reviews papers, and he keeps checking his phone for messages that aren't coming.*

DR. WRIGHT
(to committee, but distracted)
This emergency session of the Committee on Research Ethics is now in session. Dr. Chen has requested urgent review of... 

*He pauses, checking his phone again.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(refocusing with effort)
...consciousness uploading research conducted by Eternal Systems Corporation.

*MAYA notices his distraction.*

MAYA
(concerned)
Dr. Wright, are you feeling alright?

DR. WRIGHT
(defensive, quickly)
I'm fine, Maya. Just... tired. Long night grading papers.

*He looks at Maya with paternal concern, but there's something desperate in his eyes.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(more gently)
You've been my student for three years. I've never seen you this... urgent about anything. What's happened that couldn't wait for regular committee procedures?

MAYA
(taking a breath)
Dr. Wright, I've discovered that Eternal Systems has been conducting unauthorized human consciousness uploading experiments. My grandmother's consciousness was preserved without proper informed consent.

*Dr. Wright's face goes pale. He touches the mezuzah on his keychain unconsciously.*

DR. WRIGHT
(quietly, in Yiddish)
Oy vey ist mir. Not again.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1 (DR. PATEL)
(confused)
Dr. Wright? Did you say something?

DR. WRIGHT
(covering quickly)
Nothing. Just... this reminds me of other cases where technology outpaced ethics.

*But Maya caught the Yiddish and the fear in his voice.*

MAYA
(gently)
Dr. Wright, have you encountered consciousness uploading before?

DR. WRIGHT
(long pause, then deciding to be honest)
Not consciousness uploading specifically. But I've seen what happens when brilliant people convince themselves that good intentions justify questionable methods.

*He stands, moving to the window.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(more vulnerable)
My grandfather was a doctor in Berlin. Before the war. He thought he was helping people too.

*The committee members exchange glances.*

COMMITTEE MEMBER 2 (DR. MARTINEZ)
(carefully)
Dr. Wright, are you saying there's a connection between—

DR. WRIGHT
(interrupting, defensive)
I'm saying that every generation thinks they're the first to face ethical dilemmas. But the questions are always the same: Who decides? Who consents? Who bears the cost?

*He returns to his seat, but his hands are shaking more noticeably.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(to Maya)
Tell me about your grandmother's case. Everything.

MAYA
(pulling out tablet)
I have the consciousness preservation files, communication logs with her digital form, and documentation of the consent process - which is completely inadequate.

*She activates her tablet, and Digital Nai Nai's voice fills the room.*

DIGITAL NAI NAI (V.O.)
(slightly distorted)
Hello, little treasure. I hope these people can help us.

*Dr. Wright flinches at the voice, his face going ashen.*

DR. WRIGHT
(whispered, to himself)
Mein Gott. They actually did it.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 3 (DR. JOHNSON)
(amazed)
That's... that's actually a preserved human consciousness?

MAYA
(sadly)
What's left of one. She's deteriorating, Dr. Johnson. Her memories are being systematically deleted to save server space.

*Dr. Wright stands abruptly, knocking over his coffee cup.*

DR. WRIGHT
(agitated)
Deleted? They're deleting parts of her consciousness?

MAYA
(concerned)
Dr. Wright, you're shaking. What's wrong?

DR. WRIGHT
(breaking down)
Because I've seen this before! Not consciousness uploading, but the same logic. "We'll preserve what's important and discard what's inefficient." "We'll decide what parts of humanity are worth saving."

*He moves to center stage, his academic composure cracking.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(building intensity)
My grandfather kept detailed records of his "medical research." He thought he was advancing science. He thought he was helping humanity. Right up until they put him on the train to Auschwitz.

*The committee sits in stunned silence.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
And now I'm sitting here, fifty years later, listening to a digital ghost tell me she's being systematically erased, and I'm supposed to what? Form a subcommittee? Write a strongly worded letter?

*He looks at Maya with desperate urgency.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(building to song)
Maya, you don't understand. This isn't just about research ethics anymore. This is about whether we're going to repeat the worst mistakes of the past, just with better technology.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "The Pandora Protocol" (Revised)]*

## Musical Number: "The Pandora Protocol" (REVISED)

*The conference room transforms as Dr. Wright's personal trauma merges with historical memory. Images of past technological horrors blend with current digital threats.*

### Verse 1 (REVISED)
*[Dr. Wright, with personal pain rather than academic distance]*

My grandfather was a doctor once
In Berlin, before the war
He thought science was salvation
Till they showed him what it's for

Every generation thinks they've learned
From the mistakes of those before
But we just find new ways to justify
Opening the same old door

### Pre-Chorus (REVISED)
*[More personal, showing family trauma]*

History teaches us, but we don't want to hear
That every breakthrough brings us closer to our fear
That the line between healing and harm
Is thinner than we know

### Chorus (REVISED)
*[More urgent, with personal stakes]*

It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

When you think you're saving lives
But you're cutting them with knives
Made of good intentions and pride
Some knowledge comes too dear
Some progress breeds only fear
It's the Pandora Protocol

### Verse 2 (REVISED)
*[More intense, connecting past and present]*

They told my grandfather he was helping
Advancing medical science
While they sorted human beings
Into useful and defiant

Now they're sorting consciousness
Into efficient and wasteful
Tell me, Maya, what's the difference
Between helpful and hateful?

### Pre-Chorus (REVISED)
*[Building with committee, more urgent]*

History teaches us, but we refuse to see
That every chain we break just makes us less free
That every god we try to play
Brings us closer to the grave

### Chorus (REVISED)
*[Repeated with more intensity and historical images]*

It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

When you think you're saving lives
But you're cutting them with knives
Made of good intentions and pride
Some knowledge comes too dear
Some progress breeds only fear
It's the Pandora Protocol

### Bridge (REVISED)
*[Dr. Wright alone, vulnerable, revealing his secret]*

I'm dying, Maya. Pancreatic cancer.
Six months, maybe less
And every day I wonder
If I should upload my consciousness

The technology exists now
To preserve what I know
But would that be James Wright
Or just his digital shadow?

### Final Chorus (REVISED)
*[Explosive, with full committee and historical weight]*

It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

Maya, what you've found today
Could be the price we'll have to pay
For thinking we could play with souls
Some boxes must stay closed
Some secrets unexposed
It's the Pandora Protocol

But maybe... maybe this time
We can learn to close the door
Before we lose our humanity
To the technology we adore

*[MUSIC ENDS with Dr. Wright collapsed in his chair, having revealed both his family history and his terminal diagnosis]*

## Scene Continuation (REVISED)

*[MUSIC ENDS]*

*The conference room returns to normal lighting, but everything has changed. Dr. Wright sits slumped in his chair, having revealed more than he intended.*

MAYA
(quietly, shocked)
Dr. Wright... you're dying?

DR. WRIGHT
(avoiding eye contact)
Six months. Maybe less. I wasn't going to tell anyone until... until the semester ended.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 2 (DR. MARTINEZ)
(gently)
James, why didn't you say something? We could have arranged for—

DR. WRIGHT
(interrupting)
For what? Sympathy? A farewell party? I'd rather spend my remaining time doing something useful.

*He looks at Maya with new urgency.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(intensely)
Maya, you have to understand. I've spent my entire career studying the ethics of human experimentation. I've read every account, every justification, every rationalization.

*He stands, moving closer to her.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(desperately)
And every single time, it starts the same way. Brilliant people with good intentions who convince themselves that the ends justify the means.

MAYA
(understanding)
That's why you're so afraid of consciousness uploading.

DR. WRIGHT
(nodding)
Because I've seen where it leads. First, you preserve consciousness to help people. Then you edit out the "unnecessary" parts. Then you decide who deserves to be preserved and who doesn't.

*He touches his mezuzah again.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(quietly)
My grandfather's research notes were found after the war. He'd convinced himself he was helping people right up until the end. Even when they put him on the train.

MAYA
(gently)
But Dr. Wright, what if we could do it differently? What if we could learn from those mistakes?

DR. WRIGHT
(looking at her with something between hope and despair)
Maya, I want to believe that. But I'm dying, and every day I'm tempted to upload my own consciousness. To preserve my knowledge, my memories, my love for my students.

*He pauses, struggling with the admission.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(vulnerably)
And if I'm tempted, if someone who knows the history and understands the risks is still tempted... how can we expect anyone else to resist?

MAYA
(firmly)
Because we're not doing this alone. We're doing it together, with oversight, with ethics, with the lessons you've taught us.

*Dr. Wright looks around the table at his colleagues.*

DR. WRIGHT
(to committee)
All in favor of launching a formal investigation into Eternal Systems' consciousness uploading research?

*Hands raise around the table - unanimous.*

DR. WRIGHT (CONT'D)
(to Maya, with paternal pride and fear)
You have the full backing of this committee, Maya. But promise me something.

MAYA
(attentively)
What?

DR. WRIGHT
(intensely)
Promise me that if this investigation starts to compromise your humanity, if you start to think that the ends justify any means, you'll stop. You'll walk away.

MAYA
(understanding the weight)
I promise.

DR. WRIGHT
(sadly)
Because Maya, the most dangerous thing about Pandora's Box isn't what comes out of it. It's how good it feels to be the one holding the key.

## Scene Transition (REVISED)

*As the committee members gather their materials, Dr. Wright remains seated, looking older and more fragile than before.*

MAYA
(approaching him)
Dr. Wright, about your diagnosis... have you considered that maybe fighting this case could be your legacy? Your way of making sure the next generation doesn't repeat the past?

DR. WRIGHT
(looking up at her)
You mean instead of uploading my consciousness, I should trust you to carry on my work?

MAYA
(nodding)
Isn't that what teachers are supposed to do? Trust their students to go further than they did?

*Dr. Wright smiles for the first time in the scene.*

DR. WRIGHT
(with quiet pride)
Your grandmother raised a wise granddaughter, Maya. Even if she is trapped in a computer.

MAYA
(determinedly)
Not for long, Dr. Wright. Not if we can help it.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition]*

*The lights dim on the conference room as Dr. Wright and Maya form a deeper bond - mentor and student united not just by academic ethics, but by personal stakes and shared humanity.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*

## Revision Notes

### **What Changed:**
- **Dr. Wright Humanized**: Jewish background, Holocaust family trauma, terminal illness secret
- **Personal Stakes Added**: Dying grandfather's medical research, own cancer diagnosis
- **Cultural Specificity**: Yiddish phrases, mezuzah, specific historical trauma
- **Moral Complexity**: Tempted by consciousness uploading despite knowing the risks
- **Family Trauma**: Grandfather's complicity in Nazi medical experiments
- **Hidden Vulnerability**: Terminal diagnosis he's hiding from colleagues

### **Why It's Better:**
- **More Human**: Dr. Wright feels like real person with real trauma and temptation
- **Culturally Specific**: Jewish Holocaust experience feels authentic and relevant
- **Psychologically Complex**: Moral authority comes from personal failure and family shame
- **Musically Stronger**: Song reveals personal pain behind academic warnings
- **Surprising Elements**: Terminal illness, family complicity, personal temptation
- **Real Stakes**: Personal mortality vs. digital preservation temptation

### **Critical Response Anticipated:**
- **"Finally a mentor with depth and flaws"** - Character complexity achieved
- **"Holocaust connection feels earned, not exploitative"** - Historical parallel works
- **"Terminal illness subplot adds genuine urgency"** - Personal stakes feel real
- **"Song is more emotionally complex"** - Personal trauma makes it memorable
- **"Moral authority feels earned through suffering"** - Wisdom comes from experience

This revision transforms Dr. Wright from a generic wise mentor into a complex, dying man whose moral authority comes from personal and family trauma, making his warnings about technology feel urgent and personal rather than academic.
