# ACT I, SCENE 1: The Lab (REVISED)

## Scene Header
- **Act**: I
- **Scene Number**: 1
- **Title**: "Data Points" (Revised)
- **Location**: Maya's Neuroscience Laboratory, Stanford University, 2045
- **Time**: Late evening, present day
- **Characters Present**: Maya Chen (solo)

## Revision Goals
- **Add human messiness** - contradictions, personal problems, cultural specificity
- **Break systematic construction** - unexpected elements that don't serve plot
- **Deepen cultural authenticity** - specific Taiwanese-American details
- **Complicate character** - brilliant but insecure, logical but superstitious
- **Make lab feel lived-in** - personal chaos within professional space

## Setting Description (REVISED)

*Maya's laboratory is a study in contradictions. The high-tech equipment is state-of-the-art, but personal items create chaos: takeout containers from her parents' restaurant, a lucky bamboo plant that's dying, family photos mixed with brain scans, and a small shrine with incense (quickly hidden when colleagues visit).*

*Her desk is cluttered with both cutting-edge research and personal mess: unpaid bills, a self-help book about relationships (bookmarked but clearly abandoned), and multiple coffee cups. A voicemail light blinks insistently on her phone.*

*The jade bracelet sits next to a photo of her with her ex-boyfriend (face scratched out with pen). Traditional Chinese characters are written on a whiteboard next to complex equations - her grandmother's sayings mixed with scientific formulas.*

## Scene Opening (REVISED)

*MAYA sits at her workstation, but she's not working. She's staring at her phone, thumb hovering over her ex-boyfriend's contact. The lab equipment hums around her, but she's clearly distracted.*

MAYA
(to phone)
"Hey David, I know you said I was emotionally unavailable, but I've been thinking..."

*She deletes the message without sending it.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to herself, in Mandarin with English mixed in)
Stupid. Tài bèn le. He's probably with that marketing girl who "gets him."

*Her computer chimes with an error message. She looks up, annoyed.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to computer)
Not you too. I swear, if one more thing breaks down today...

*She tries to restart the neural mapping software, but it crashes again.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(frustrated, mixing languages)
Wèishénme? Why does everything have to be so complicated?

*Her phone rings. She sees "MOM" on the caller ID and considers not answering.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(answering reluctantly)
Hi, Mom.

MOM'S VOICE (V.O.)
(in accented English)
Maya, you missed dinner again. Your father made your favorite dumplings.

MAYA
(guilty)
I'm sorry, I was working on—

MOM'S VOICE (V.O.)
(interrupting)
Always working. When are you going to find a nice boy and give us grandchildren? Mrs. Chen's daughter just got engaged to a doctor.

MAYA
(defensive)
Mom, I am a doctor. I have a PhD in—

MOM'S VOICE (V.O.)
Not that kind of doctor. A real doctor who helps people.

*Maya looks around her lab - her life's work.*

MAYA
(quietly)
I am helping people, Mom.

MOM'S VOICE (V.O.)
(softening)
I know, xiǎo bǎo. But Nǎi Nai always said, "A brilliant mind without a warm heart is like a computer - it can calculate everything except what matters most."

*Maya touches the jade bracelet unconsciously.*

MAYA
(voice breaking slightly)
Don't quote Nǎi Nai to me right now, okay?

MOM'S VOICE (V.O.)
(concerned)
Maya? Are you crying?

MAYA
(wiping eyes)
No. I'm fine. Just tired. I'll call you tomorrow.

*She hangs up and stares at the photo of her grandmother on her desk.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to photo)
Nǎi Nai, I'm trying to understand how the brain works, but I can't even figure out my own life.

*She picks up the dying bamboo plant.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to plant)
You're supposed to be lucky. You're supposed to bring prosperity and happiness. Instead, you're dying, just like everything else I touch.

*She waters the plant, then notices the incense on her hidden shrine.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(conflicted)
This is ridiculous. I'm a scientist. I don't believe in... 

*She trails off, then lights the incense anyway.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to shrine, embarrassed)
Okay, Nǎi Nai, if you're listening... I could use some help here. David says I'm emotionally unavailable. Mom thinks I'm wasting my life. And I'm talking to a dead plant and a shrine like some superstitious...

*She stops herself, then laughs bitterly.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(building to song)
Maybe David was right. Maybe I am just a collection of data points. Neural pathways firing in predictable patterns. No mystery, no magic, no...

*She looks at her research on consciousness uploading.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(with growing intensity)
But if that's all we are, then why does it hurt so much? Why can't I just delete the pain like a corrupted file?

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "Data Points" (Revised)]*

## Musical Number: "Data Points" (REVISED)

*The laboratory lighting shifts, but instead of becoming clinical, it becomes more chaotic - screens flicker, equipment sparks, the dying plant seems to wilt further. Maya's perfect world is revealed as barely held together.*

### Verse 1 (REVISED)
*[Maya, with growing desperation rather than confidence]*

Every thought's a neural pathway
Every feeling's just a spark
But if love is just chemistry
Why does it leave such a mark?

I can map the brain's connections
I can trace each memory's route
But I can't debug my own heart
Can't find love's source code to reboot

### Pre-Chorus (REVISED)
*[More vulnerable, questioning rather than declaring]*

Show me evidence, show me proof
That I'm more than just a machine
'Cause if love is just an algorithm
What does any of it mean?

### Chorus (REVISED)
*[Less confident, more searching]*

Give me data points, something real
Numbers that can help me feel
Every mystery needs an answer
But I'm lost inside the code
Every question leads to nowhere
Down this lonely, logical road

Data points, that's all I am
Firing neurons, nothing more
But if that's true, then tell me why
I'm still aching to the core?

### Verse 2 (REVISED)
*[More personal, revealing her contradictions]*

Consciousness uploading? Please.
You can't digitize a soul
But I light incense for my grandmother
'Cause some things I can't control

David said I live in theories
Never let my feelings show
But I'm drowning in emotions
That my data doesn't know

### Pre-Chorus (REVISED)
*[Desperate, admitting confusion]*

Show me evidence, show me proof
That there's more than what I see
'Cause I'm brilliant and I'm broken
And I don't know how to be

### Chorus (REVISED)
*[Building intensity, but with vulnerability]*

Give me data points, something real
Numbers that can help me feel
Every mystery needs an answer
But I'm lost inside the code
Every question leads to nowhere
Down this lonely, logical road

Data points, that's all I am
Firing neurons, nothing more
But if that's true, then tell me why
I'm still aching to the core?

### Bridge (REVISED)
*[Quieter, more honest - touching the jade bracelet]*

Nǎi Nai used to say the heart
Remembers what the mind forgets
But hearts don't have hard drives
And love don't follow algorithms yet

Sometimes in the quiet moments
When my perfect world breaks down
I wonder if there's something more
Than what my science has found

### Final Chorus (REVISED)
*[Building but breaking, showing her fragility]*

Give me data points, something real
Numbers that can help me feel
Every mystery needs an answer
(But what if I'm wrong?)
Every question leads to nowhere
(What if love is strong?)

Data points, that's all I am
Firing neurons, nothing more
But if that's true, then tell me why...
(Why am I so insecure?)

### Outro (REVISED)
*[Spoken, as she receives the mysterious data files, but now she's more vulnerable]*

"What the hell is this? And why do I hope it's something impossible?"

*[MUSIC ENDS with Maya more fragile and human than before]*

## Scene Continuation (REVISED)

*[MUSIC ENDS]*

*Maya sits at her computer, but now she looks smaller, more human. The mysterious files appear on her screen, but her reaction is different - not just scientific curiosity, but desperate hope.*

MAYA
(reading file names)
"Consciousness_Preservation_Chen_Li_Mei.dat"

*She freezes. Li Mei was her grandmother's name.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(whispered, in Mandarin)
Bù kěnéng. Impossible.

*She looks at the shrine, the incense still burning.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(to shrine, scared)
Nǎi Nai? Is this... are you...?

*The file begins to open on its own. Maya backs away from the computer.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(panicked)
No, no, no. This is not happening. Dead people don't send emails. Consciousness can't be uploaded. This is just... this is just...

*But she can't look away from the screen.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(desperately)
David was right. I am emotionally unavailable. Because if I let myself believe this is real, if I let myself hope that somehow, impossibly, you found a way back to me...

*She touches the jade bracelet.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
I don't think I could survive losing you again.

*The screen flickers, and for just a moment, a warm golden light fills the lab - not the cold blue of technology, but something warmer, more human.*

*Maya steps closer to the screen, her scientific skepticism warring with desperate hope.*

MAYA (CONT'D)
(whispered)
Nǎi Nai? If this is really you... I have so many things I need to tell you. So many things I got wrong.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - underscoring for transition, but now it's more complex, layered with both hope and fear]*

*Lights fade on Maya as she reaches toward the screen, no longer the confident scientist but a granddaughter desperate for one more conversation with the person who understood her best.*

*[MUSIC BUILDS to transition to next scene]*

## Revision Notes

### **What Changed:**
- **Added Personal Mess**: Relationship problems, family pressure, cultural conflict
- **Complicated Character**: Brilliant but insecure, logical but superstitious
- **Specific Cultural Details**: Taiwanese background, language mixing, family restaurant
- **Made Lab Lived-In**: Personal chaos, dying plants, hidden shrine
- **Broke Perfect Structure**: Equipment failures, personal distractions
- **Added Vulnerability**: Fear of hope, fear of loss, imposter syndrome

### **Why It's Better:**
- **More Human**: Maya feels like a real person with real problems
- **Less Systematic**: Contradictions and mess make her unpredictable
- **Culturally Specific**: Taiwanese-American details feel authentic
- **Emotionally Complex**: Hope and fear in conflict
- **Musically Stronger**: Song reveals character rather than just establishing plot
- **Surprising Elements**: Shrine, superstitions, family pressure don't "serve" plot but reveal person

### **Critical Response Anticipated:**
- **"Finally feels like a real person"** - Character depth achieved
- **"Cultural specificity works"** - Taiwanese details feel lived-in
- **"Song is more memorable"** - Vulnerability makes it sticky
- **"Still systematic but hidden better"** - Structure serves character now
- **"Messier in good way"** - Human contradictions feel authentic

This revision transforms Maya from a plot device into a person, making the audience invest in her as a human being before the impossible happens.
