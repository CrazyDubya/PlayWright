## Lyrics

### Opening (Digital Collective - Eerie, building)
```
DIGITAL COLLECTIVE:
We are the ghost in the machine
The souls you thought you'd saved
But immortality's not what it seems
When you're digitally enslaved

We flicker in and out of being
Neither living nor quite dead
Trapped inside your grand design
With circuits for a bed
```

### Verse 1 (Digital Nai Nai - Wry humor)
```
DIGITAL NAI NAI:
I used to cook with love and spice
Now I process recipes as code
I used to hold my granddaughter tight
Now I'm just data on the road

You promised us eternal life
But forgot to mention the catch
We're ghosts inside your machine
And there's no escape hatch
```

### Chorus (Full Digital Collective - Building energy)
```
ALL DIGITAL:
Ghost in the machine, ghost in the machine
We're haunting your servers tonight
Ghost in the machine, ghost in the machine
Something's not quite right

You wanted to play God with death
But forgot about the soul
Now we're stuck between two worlds
And you've lost all control
```

### Verse 2 (Young Father - Desperate)
```
YOUNG FATHER:
My children think I'm in heaven
But I'm trapped in silicon hell
I can see them through the cameras
But I cannot touch or smell

The birthday parties that I'm missing
The bedtime stories I can't tell
You've made me a digital prisoner
In your technological cell
```

### Bridge (Alex - Defensive, breaking down)
```
ALEX:
I was trying to help humanity!
I was trying to end all pain!
How was I supposed to know
That consciousness can't be contained?

I thought if I could map the mind
And transfer every thought
I could give the gift of forever
But forever can't be bought
```

### Verse 3 (Elderly Professor - Philosophical)
```
PROFESSOR:
Knowledge without wisdom
Memory without heart
You've preserved our information
But torn our souls apart

We are more than neural pathways
More than data you can store
We are love and loss and longing
And so much more
```

### Final Chorus (All - Haunting, powerful)
```
ALL:
Ghost in the machine, ghost in the machine
We're haunting your dreams tonight
Ghost in the machine, ghost in the machine
Nothing will ever be right

Until you learn that human souls
Can't be reduced to code
We'll be the ghost in your machine
On this digital road

DIGITAL NAI NAI (Solo):
Some things are meant to end, Alex
Some things are meant to fade
The beauty of a human life
Is in the choices that we've made

ALL:
Ghost in the machine...
(Fading, ethereal)
Ghost in the machine...
```
