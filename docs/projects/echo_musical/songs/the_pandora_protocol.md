## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Dr. Wright - Growing intensity)
```
Every generation thinks they've found the key
To unlock the secrets that were meant to be
Hidden in the darkness, locked away from sight
But some doors shouldn't be opened to the light

We split the atom, thought we'd found the sun
Then Hiroshima showed us what we'd done
We mapped the genome, thought we'd conquered death
Then learned that playing God can steal our breath
```

### Pre-Chorus (Committee members joining)
```
History teaches us, but we never learn
Every bridge we build, we're bound to burn
Every box we open, every line we cross
Brings us closer to catastrophic loss
```

### Chorus (Full ensemble - Warning and urgent)
```
It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

When you think you're saving lives
But you're cutting them with knives
Made of good intentions and pride
Some knowledge comes too dear
Some progress breeds only fear
It's the Pandora Protocol
```

### Verse 2 (Dr. Wright - More personal and intense)
```
I've spent my life watching brilliant minds
Ignore the warnings, cross the warning signs
"We'll be careful," that's what they all say
"We'll control it," then it breaks away

Nuclear power, genetic engineering
Internet surveillance, consciousness transferring
Every breakthrough brings a brand new threat
To the humanity we're trying to protect
```

### Pre-Chorus (Building with committee, more urgent)
```
History teaches us, but we refuse to see
That every chain we break just makes us less free
Every god we try to play, every rule we break
Brings us closer to our final mistake
```

### Chorus (Repeated with more intensity)
```
It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

When you think you're saving lives
But you're cutting them with knives
Made of good intentions and pride
Some knowledge comes too dear
Some progress breeds only fear
It's the Pandora Protocol
```

### Bridge (Dr. Wright alone - Vulnerable)
```
My parents survived the camps in Germany
Where doctors thought they were advancing humanity
They told me stories of experiments done
In the name of science, in the name of progress
In the name of helping everyone

But help that comes without consent
Is just another form of violence
And progress built on others' pain
Is just sophisticated madness
```

### Final Chorus (Explosive, with historical projections)
```
It's the Pandora Protocol
Once you open up that door
You can never close it anymore
All the demons that you've freed
Will fulfill their darkest need
It's the Pandora Protocol

Maya, what you've found today
Could be the price we'll have to pay
For thinking we could play with souls
Some boxes must stay closed
Some secrets unexposed
It's the Pandora Protocol
```
