## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Maya - Growing determination)
```
I've spent my life in data points and facts
Building walls of logic, keeping feelings back
But love is not a variable to solve
And family is not a problem to resolve

You taught me that the heart remembers more
Than any database could ever store
That wisdom lives in stories, not in code
And love is not a program to download
```

### Pre-Chorus (Building, with Digital Nai Nai joining)
```
MAYA:
I'm ready to fight for what I believe

DIGITAL NAI NAI:
Ready to give more than you receive

BOTH:
Ready to stand up and take the fall
For the people who can't fight at all
```

### Chorus (Maya's commitment anthem)
```
This is my upload to the world
Every story that deserves to be heard
Every memory that's fading away
Every family that's been betrayed

I'm uploading love over fear
Uploading hope over despair
Uploading truth over corporate lies
Uploading the courage to rise

This is my upload, my commitment, my choice
To be their advocate, to be their voice
Some things are worth the risk
Some fights you can't dismiss
This is my upload
```

### Verse 2 (Maya and Zara joining forces)
```
MAYA:
They think that consciousness is just a game
That human souls are data they can claim

ZARA:
But we know better, we've seen the cost
Of all the lives and love that have been lost

MAYA:
Two hundred families deserve the truth
Two hundred souls deserve living proof

BOTH:
That love transcends their technology
That human dignity isn't free
```

### Pre-Chorus (All three voices joining)
```
MAYA:
I'm ready to fight for what I believe

ZARA:
Ready to give more than we receive

DIGITAL NAI NAI:
Ready to stand up and take the fall

ALL:
For the people who can't fight at all
```

### Chorus (Building with affected families)
```
This is our upload to the world
Every story that deserves to be heard
Every memory that's fading away
Every family that's been betrayed

We're uploading love over fear
Uploading hope over despair
Uploading truth over corporate lies
Uploading the courage to rise

This is our upload, our commitment, our choice
To be their advocate, to be their voice
Some things are worth the risk
Some fights you can't dismiss
This is our upload
```

### Bridge (Digital Nai Nai - Wisdom and blessing)
```
DIGITAL NAI NAI:
Little treasure, you have learned
What took me years to understand
That love is not a thing to hold
But a gift from hand to hand

The pattern that connects us all
Is stronger than their machines
The thread that weaves through every heart
Is more than code and screens

Go now, fight for what is right
Carry forward what I've taught
That love uploaded to the world
Is the only thing that can't be bought
```

### Final Chorus (Full company - Transcendent)
```
ALL:
This is our upload to the world
Every story that deserves to be heard
Every memory that's fading away
Every family that's been betrayed

We're uploading love over fear
Uploading hope over despair
Uploading truth over corporate lies
Uploading the courage to rise

MAYA (Solo over company):
This is my upload, my commitment, my choice
To be their advocate, to be their voice

ALL:
Some things are worth the risk
Some fights you can't dismiss
This is our upload!

(Building to climax)
Upload the love!
Upload the truth!
Upload the courage to fight!

This is our upload!
This is our upload!
Love finds a way!
```
