## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Maya - Solo, Introspective)
```
I've spent my life in equations
Mapping neurons, tracing thought
Every mystery has an answer
Every question can be caught

But standing here between two worlds
One of flesh and one of light
I'm learning that the deepest truths
Live beyond our human sight
```

### Chorus 1 (Maya - Building)
```
Beyond the code, beyond the data
Beyond what science can explain
There's something that transcends the flesh
Something that will still remain

When circuits fail and servers crash
When bodies age and memories fade
The love that binds us heart to heart
Is stronger than the forms we've made
```

### Verse 2 (Digital Nai Nai joins)
```
DIGITAL NAI NAI:
Little treasure, you're discovering
What I learned so long ago
Love is not a program running
Love is how the spirit grows
```

### Chorus 2 (Maya & Digital Nai Nai - Harmony)
```
BOTH:
Beyond the code, beyond the data
Beyond what death can take away
The thread that connects every heart
Will guide us to a brighter day
```

### Bridge (Alex - Conflicted, from video screen)
```
ALEX:
But without control, without structure
Everything will fall apart
How can we trust in something
That we cannot chart?

MAYA:
By letting go of the illusion
That we can master life and death
By trusting in the connections
That give meaning to each breath
```

### Chorus 3 (Full Company - Transcendent)
```
ALL:
Beyond the code, beyond the data
Beyond what fear can comprehend
Love finds a way to bridge the gap
Between beginning and the end
```

### Final Verse/Outro (Maya - Solo, Full Belt)
```
MAYA:
I choose to trust what I can't measure
I choose to love what I can't save
I choose to honor your memory
By living fully, being brave

Beyond the code, beyond the data
Beyond what science thought was true
The greatest discovery of all
Is that love transcends me and you

(Sustained high note on "you" - A5)
Beyond the code...
(Soft finish)
Beyond the code.
```
