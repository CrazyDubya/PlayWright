## Autonomous Writing Priorities

### Current Focus: Building Core Scenes
The scaffolding system should prioritize:

1. **Character-driven scenes** that establish relationships
2. **Musical integration** that feels natural and necessary
3. **Cultural authenticity** in Chinese-American representation
4. **Technical feasibility** for digital effects and staging
5. **Emotional resonance** that serves universal themes

### Decision-Making Framework Active
- When stuck: Use creative generators and decision engine
- Character choices: What would this specific person do?
- Plot advancement: What raises stakes and creates conflict?
- Musical moments: Where does emotion demand song?
- Cultural elements: How to honor heritage authentically?

### Quality Checkpoints
- Every scene advances plot or develops character
- Every song serves dramatic function
