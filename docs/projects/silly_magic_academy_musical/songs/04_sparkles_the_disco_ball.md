## LYRICS

### Intro (Sparkles, discovering new form)
🎵 *(Spoken, with growing excitement)*
*Wait a minute... what's this feeling?*
*I'm shiny! I'm bright! I'm...*
*(Sung, with disco flair)*
*I'M FABULOUS!*

### Verse 1 (Sparkles, pure joy)
🎵 *I used to be a little hamster*
*Running on my wheel all day*
*But now I'm something so much grander*
*A disco ball in every way!*

*I've got lights that flash and sparkle*
*I've got rhythm in my soul*
*I'm no longer small and simple*
*I'm a shiny disco ball!*

### Chorus (Sparkles with ensemble backup)
🎵 *I'm Sparkles the disco ball!* *(Ensemble: "Sparkle, sparkle!")*
*Dancing bright for one and all!* *(Ensemble: "Shine so bright!")*
*Spinning, grinning, never fall!* *(Ensemble: "Never fall!")*
*I'm Sparkles the disco ball!*

*Boogie-woogie, here I go!* *(Ensemble: "Here we go!")*
*Lighting up the magic show!* *(Ensemble: "Magic show!")*
*From my head down to my toe!* *(Ensemble: "Head to toe!")*
*I'm the star of every show!*

### Verse 2 (Sparkles, addressing the "problem")
🎵 *Now everyone thinks I'm a problem*
*They want to change me back*
*But I love being big and sparkly*
*There's nothing that I lack!*

*I know I'm not what they expected*
*But different can be cool*
*So let's dance instead of worry*
*And break the boring rule!*

### Bridge (Sparkles, philosophical but funky)
🎵 *They say I'm a mistake*
*But look at all the joy I make!*
*I light up every corner*
*I make the whole room shake!*

*So what if I'm not normal?*
*So what if I'm not small?*
*I'd rather be a disco ball*
*Than nothing much at all!*

### Dance Break (Instrumental with calls)
🎵 *(Sparkles calling out dance moves)*
*"Everybody clap your hands!"* *(Clap, clap, clap!)*
*"Now spin around like me!"* *(Spin, spin, spin!)*
*"Wave your wands up in the air!"* *(Wave, wave, wave!)*
*"Let your magic sparkle free!"* *(Sparkle sounds)*

### Final Chorus (Full company, maximum energy)
🎵 *We're dancing with the disco ball!* *(All: "Sparkle, sparkle!")*
*Shining bright for one and all!* *(All: "Shine so bright!")*
*Magic, music, having a ball!* *(All: "Having a ball!")*
*With Sparkles the disco ball!*

*Boogie-woogie, here we go!* *(All: "Here we go!")*
*This is the best magic show!* *(All: "Magic show!")*
*From our heads down to our toes!* *(All: "Head to toe!")*
*Sparkles is the star of the show!*

### Outro (Sparkles, triumphant)
🎵 *So remember when you're different*
*And you don't know what to do*
*Just sparkle like a disco ball*
*And let your light shine through!*

*(Spoken, with a wink)*
*That's right, baby! Sparkles is here to stay!*
*(Musical sting and lights out)*
