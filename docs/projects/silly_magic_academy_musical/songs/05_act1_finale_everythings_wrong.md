## LYRICS

### Opening (Professor, surveying the magical chaos)
🎵 *Look around this academy*
*Magic's everywhere you see*
*Nothing's working like it should*
*But somehow... it's all good!*

### Verse 1 (Ensemble, describing the chaos)
🎵 *The stairs are singing opera*
*The books are doing ballet*
*The soup is changing colors*
*In a most peculiar way*

*The flowers are telling jokes*
*The mirrors show the past*
*And Sparkles keeps on spinning*
*Having such a blast!*

### Chorus (Full Company, celebrating)
🎵 *Everything's wrong, and that's alright!*
*Everything's wrong, what a sight!*
*When magic goes sideways*
*It's still magic, don't you see?*
*Everything's wrong*
*And that's how it's meant to be!*

### Verse 2 (Students, each adding to the chaos)
🎵 *BOOM: "My explosions made it rain!"*
*FLUTTER: "I'm flying through a window pane!"*
*MUDDLE: "My potions turned the floor to jelly!"*
*TICKLE: "Everyone's laughing in their belly!"*

*SNOOZE: "I'm dreaming while awake!"*
*WHISPER: "The silence learned to shake!"*
*PERFECTA: "My perfect spells went wild!"*
*ALL: "We're magical and mild!"*

### Chorus (Bigger, with harmonies)
🎵 *Everything's wrong, and that's alright!*
*Everything's wrong, what a sight!*
*When magic goes sideways*
*It's still magic, don't you see?*
*Everything's wrong*
*And that's how it's meant to be!*

### Bridge (Pip, feeling overwhelmed - emotional low point)
🎵 *But what about me?*
*I don't fit in this crazy scene*
*My magic doesn't work at all*
*I'm not part of this magical dream*

*(Pip starts to leave)*

*Maybe I should go*
*Maybe I don't belong*
*In a place where everything's right*
*About being wrong*

### Response (Ensemble, realizing Pip's pain)
🎵 *Wait, Pip, don't go!*
*We need you here with us*
*Your magic might be different*
*But that's not something to discuss*

*PROFESSOR: "Every kind of magic*
*Has its place and time*
*Even the quiet, hidden kind*
*That's harder to define"*

### Building Section (Everyone searching for Pip)
🎵 *Where did Pip go?*
*We have to find them now*
*Our magical family*
*Isn't complete somehow*

*SPARKLES: "I may be a disco ball*
*But I know what friendship means*
*We stick together through it all*
*In all our magical scenes!"*

### Climactic Chorus (Full company, with determination)
🎵 *Everything's wrong, and that's alright!*
*But something's missing from our sight!*
*When magic goes sideways*
*We need everyone to see*
*Everything's wrong*
*But we're still family!*

### Final Section (Building to intermission)
🎵 *We'll find our friend*
*We'll make things right*
*Not by fixing all the magic*
*But by sharing our light*

*PROFESSOR: "The greatest magic of them all*
*Is friendship, love, and care*
*And that's a lesson worth learning*
*For everyone to share"*

### Finale (All, with magical crescendo)
🎵 *Everything's wrong!* *(And that's alright!)*
*Everything's wrong!* *(What a sight!)*
*But together we'll discover*
*What magic's meant to be*

*Everything's wrong* *(Everything's wrong)*
*Everything's wrong* *(Everything's wrong)*
*But we'll make it right*
*With friendship's magic key!*

*(Musical climax with magical effects)*

### Outro (Spoken, as lights dim)
🎵 *PROFESSOR: "Come back after intermission, young wizards...*
*The real magic is just beginning."*

*(Sparkles spins one last time)*
*SPARKLES: "Don't worry, baby - we'll find our friend!"*
