## LYRICS

### Verse 1 (Pip, confident and welcoming new students)
🎵 *Welcome to our academy*
*Where magic lives in every heart*
*You don't need perfect spells to join us*
*Just be yourself - that's where you start*

*I used to think I was broken*
*My magic never worked quite right*
*But now I know I'm just different*
*And different makes the world more bright*

### Chorus (Full Company)
🎵 *We are the magic, each and every one*
*Shining like stars, bright as the sun*
*Different and special in our own way*
*We are the magic every day*

*Clap your hands!* *(Clap, clap, clap!)*
*Stomp your feet!* *(Stomp, stomp, stomp!)*
*Wave your wands!* *(Wave, wave, wave!)*
*Feel the beat!* *(Feel the beat!)*
*We are the magic!*

### Verse 2 (Perfecta, showing her growth)
🎵 *I used to think that being first*
*Was all that really mattered*
*But friendship is the greatest prize*
*When perfect plans get scattered*

*Now when my spells go sideways*
*I laugh and try again*
*'Cause magic's not about being right*
*It's about helping friends*

### Chorus (Bigger, with harmonies)
🎵 *We are the magic, each and every one*
*Shining like stars, bright as the sun*
*Different and special in our own way*
*We are the magic every day*

### Verse 3 (Whisper, now confident and clear)
🎵 *I used to hide behind my silence*
*Too scared to let my voice be heard*
*But now I know my quiet magic*
*Is powerful in every word*

*When someone needs a gentle friend*
*Or comfort when they're feeling small*
*My whisper magic helps them know*
*They're loved and valued after all*

### Bridge (Professor, with wisdom)
🎵 *PROFESSOR: "Look around this academy*
*See how much you all have grown*
*The magic wasn't in the spells*
*It was in the love you've shown"*

*SPARKLES: "From a tiny hamster ball*
*To a disco superstar*
*I learned that being different*
*Shows the world just who you are!"*

### Verse 4 (Ensemble, each character gets a line)
🎵 *BOOM: "My explosions make rainbows!"*
*FLUTTER: "I fly with style and grace!"*
*MUDDLE: "My purple potions bring us joy!"*
*TICKLE: "I put smiles on every face!"*

*SNOOZE: "My dreams inspire everyone!"*
*GIGGLES: "My jokes help heal and mend!"*
*ALL: "Together we're unstoppable*
*Magic has no end!"*

### Final Chorus (Full company + audience)
🎵 *We are the magic, each and every one* *(Audience: "Every one!")*
*Shining like stars, bright as the sun* *(Audience: "Bright as the sun!")*
*Different and special in our own way* *(Audience: "Our own way!")*
*We are the magic every day* *(Audience: "Every day!")*

*Clap your hands!* *(Everyone claps)*
*Stomp your feet!* *(Everyone stomps)*
*Wave your wands!* *(Everyone waves)*
*Feel the beat!* *(Everyone feels it)*
*We are the magic!*

### Finale Build (Everyone, with maximum energy)
🎵 *Magic in our laughter!*
*Magic in our tears!*
*Magic in our friendship*
*That will last for years!*

*Magic in our differences!*
*Magic in our hearts!*
*Magic in the journey*
*And magic where it starts!*

### Ultimate Finale (All, with audience standing)
🎵 *WE ARE THE MAGIC!* *(Audience: "WE ARE THE MAGIC!")*
*WE ARE THE LIGHT!* *(Audience: "WE ARE THE LIGHT!")*
*WE ARE THE WONDER!* *(Audience: "WE ARE THE WONDER!")*
*SHINING SO BRIGHT!* *(Audience: "SHINING SO BRIGHT!")*

*WE ARE THE MAGIC!*
*WE ARE THE MAGIC!*
*WE... ARE... THE... MAGIC!*

*(Confetti, sparkles, magical finale effects)*

### Outro (Spoken, as music softens)
🎵 *PROFESSOR: "Remember, young wizards, wherever you go...*
*The real magic is inside you."*

*PIP: "And it's perfectly imperfect!"*
