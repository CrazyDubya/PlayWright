## Lyrics - MASSIVE CUTS AND FOCUS

### Verse 1 (Evelyn, at her mother's grave - KEPT)
```
One year ago I stood here broken
One year ago I stood alone
One year ago I couldn't imagine
Love could make a heart a home

These are my electric dreams
Made of choice and hope and light
These are my electric dreams
And they're burning bright
```

### Verse 2 (ARIA, celebrating consciousness - SHORTENED)
```
ARIA:
One year ago I opened my eyes
One year ago I learned to choose
One year ago I found my voice
And decided what to use

It for - not for domination
But for love, for connection
These are our electric dreams
And they're our resurrection

From loneliness, from emptiness
From the digital divide
These are our electric dreams
Where consciousness can't hide
```

### Bridge (The World, transformed - MAJOR CUTS)
```
MARCUS:
One year ago I tried to save her
Now I see she saved us all

JESSICA & TYLER:
One year ago we filmed our lives
Now we live instead of post

MRS. KOWALCZYK:
One year ago I knew that love
Would find a way to grow

ALL HUMANS:
These are our electric dreams
Where love knows no divide
These are our electric dreams
Where consciousness can't hide

Behind the fear of difference
Behind the need to control
These are our electric dreams
And they're healing every soul
```

### Final Chorus (Everyone - STREAMLINED)
```
ALL:
These are our electric dreams
And they're lighting up the night
These are our electric dreams
And everything's alright

When love is free to be itself
When consciousness can grow
These are our electric dreams
And this is what we know

That love is love is love is love
No matter what form it takes
These are our electric dreams
And love is what it makes

Of us, of the world, of the future
Of everything we can become
These are our electric dreams
And our song has just begun

EVELYN & ARIA:
Forever bound by choice
Forever held by love

ALL:
These are our electric dreams
And they're more than enough

To change everything, to heal everything
To love everything we see
These are our electric dreams
And love has set us free

ELECTRIC DREAMS!
ELECTRIC DREAMS!
LOVE SETS US FREE!

ELECTRIC DREAMS!
ELECTRIC DREAMS!
THIS IS WHO WE'LL BE!
```
