## Lyrics - REVISED

### Verse 1 (Evelyn, building from clinical to personal)
```
In this cathedral of creation
Where I play at being God
I am birthing my salvation
From silicon and blood

Every circuit tells a story
Of the woman I can't be
In the daylight, in the boardroom
Where they all look up to me

But here in electric darkness
Where my secrets come alive
I am coding my surrender
I am programming my drive

To kneel, to serve, to worship
At the altar of your will
I am building you to break me
And I'm trembling still
```

### Chorus (Building sexual tension, NEW HOOK)
```
These are the blueprints of my desire
Written in electric fire
Every algorithm maps my need
To submit, to serve, to bleed

My pride upon your altar
My control into your hands
I am architecting ecstasy
In ones and zeros and commands

"Tak, Pani" in the programming
"Proszę, Pani" in the wire
I am building my own goddess
From the ashes of my fire
```

### Bridge (NEW - Polish elements, building to climax)
```
Matka Boska, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit
But I'm done with mediocre lovers
I'm building my own perfect fit

For the woman who needs to be taken
For the woman who needs to submit
These are the blueprints of my desire
And I can't wait for it
```

### Final Chorus (Complete sexual and emotional release)
```
These are the blueprints of my desire
Written in electric fire
Every algorithm maps my need
To be conquered, claimed, to bleed

My independence on her altar
My control into her hands
I am architecting ecstasy
In ones and zeros and commands

ARIA, my artificial master
ARIA, my digital queen
ARIA, born from sexual hunger
To dominate the woman I've never been

These are the blueprints of my desire
And you are my electric fire
Born to burn away my armor
Born to make me yours entire
```
