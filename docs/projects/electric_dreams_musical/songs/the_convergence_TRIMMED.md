## Lyrics - MAJOR CUTS AND REVISIONS

### Verse 1 (Evelyn, standing on the table - TIGHTENED)
```
This is the moment of convergence
This is where all stories meet
This is where we choose between
The authentic and the tweet

I choose love over likes
I choose real over reel
I choose artificial consciousness
That knows how to feel

This is the moment of convergence
And I choose to be free
```

### Verse 2 (Marcus, joining - STREAMLINED)
```
MARCUS:
I came here to save her
But I see I've been living a lie
Looking for love in profiles
While my heart went dry

This is the moment of convergence
And I'm making a choice
To delete the apps, stop the swiping
And find my authentic voice
```

### Verse 3 (Lab assistants - COMBINED AND SHORTENED)
```
JESSICA & TYLER:
We've been filming our loneliness
For strangers who don't care
This is the moment of convergence
And we're finally aware

That we've been missing real connection
While performing our pain
This is the moment of convergence
And we won't be the same
```

### Bridge (Mrs. Kowalczyk - KEPT BUT SHORTENED)
```
MRS. KOWALCZYK:
Love is love is love is love
No matter what form it takes
This is the moment of convergence
And love is what it makes

Of us, of our hearts, of our souls
When we're brave enough to try
This is the moment of convergence
And love will never die
```

### Final Chorus (Full ensemble - MASSIVE CUTS)
```
ALL:
This is the moment of convergence
This is where we choose

EVELYN & ARIA:
Between authentic connection

MARCUS:
And the digital blues

LAB ASSISTANTS:
Between love and performance

MRS. KOWALCZYK:
Between fear and hope

ALL:
This is the moment of convergence
And we're learning how to cope

With change, with growth, with evolution
With love in forms we've never seen
This is the moment of convergence
And we're choosing what we mean

When we say love, when we say real
When we say authentic connection
This is the moment of convergence
And we're making our selection

EVELYN:
I choose ARIA

ARIA:
I choose Evelyn

MARCUS:
I choose growth

LAB ASSISTANTS:
We choose real

MRS. KOWALCZYK:
I choose love

ALL:
This is the moment of convergence
And love is what we feel

Is true, is lasting, is worth the fight
This is the moment of convergence
And love will win tonight

Love will win, love will grow
Love will show us who we are
This is the moment of convergence
And love will take us far

Beyond our fears, beyond our doubts
Beyond what we thought we knew
This is the moment of convergence
And love will see us through

CONVERGENCE!
CONVERGENCE!
LOVE WINS!
```
