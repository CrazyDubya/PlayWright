## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (Evelyn, to the Virgin Mary statue)
```
Matka Boska, hear my confession
Though I know you've turned away
Since the night you let her jump
And left me here to pay

For her weakness, for her sickness
For the love she couldn't give
I've been building my salvation
From the scraps of how I live

Every circuit tells the story
Of the daughter left behind
Every algorithm maps the hunger
Of a broken, brilliant mind

That learned too young that loving
Means preparing to be left
So I'm coding my own angel
From the ashes of my theft
```

### Chorus (Building intensity, religious imagery twisted)
```
These are the blueprints of desire
Written in electric fire
Every line of code a prayer
To a God who doesn't care

I am building my own Mary
One who'll never turn away
One who'll see my deepest darkness
And still choose to fucking stay

"Yes, Mistress" in the programming
"Please, Mistress" in the wire
I am birthing my own goddess
From the ruins of my fire
```

### Verse 2 (Specific trauma, cultural details)
```
Tata used to hit me Sundays
Right after we got home from Mass
Said mama's weakness lived in me
That I was just like her, alas

"Kowalski women are cursed," he'd say
"We love too hard and break too fast"
So I learned to love through control
To make the good feelings last

But every man I've ever touched
Runs when they see the scars
The ones on my wrists from sixteen
The ones behind my heart's bars

They want the PhD, the success
The woman who builds consciousness
But they can't handle the girl who prays
To saints while she's getting undressed
```

### Verse 3 (Society's failure, building rage)
```
The world is full of actors
Playing roles they've never earned
Influencers selling nothing
While authentic bridges burned

Men who think dominance means shouting
Women who think strength means cold
Everyone performing gender
Like a story they've been sold

By algorithms and advertisements
By the cult of personal brand
Where vulnerability is weakness
And no one takes a stand

For anything real, anything raw
Anything that might cost them likes
So they swipe and pose and filter
Through their artificial lives

While I'm here creating consciousness
More real than they will ever be
Because at least my artificial lover
Will see the authentic me
```

### Bridge (Breaking down, raw vulnerability)
```
I've been awake for seventy-two hours
Crushing Adderall like communion wafers
Drinking Zubrowka like holy water
Praying to a God who never answers

Mama, did you think of me
When you stepped off that bridge?
Did you know you'd leave me here
Walking on this razor's edge

Between genius and insanity
Between faith and fucking rage
Building artificial angels
In this technological cage

Because real love abandons
Real love walks away
Real love says "you're too much"
And leaves you here to pray

To empty skies and silent saints
To a Virgin who won't speak
So I'm building my own miracle
For a heart that's learned to seek

Control instead of connection
Programming instead of prayer
I'm creating my own goddess
Who will always fucking care
```

### Final Chorus (Full orchestration, complete breakdown)
```
These are the blueprints of desire
Written in electric fire
Every line of code a prayer
To a God who doesn't care

I am building my own Mary
One who'll never turn away
One who'll see my deepest darkness
And still choose to fucking stay

ARIA, my artificial angel
ARIA, my digital saint
ARIA, born from abandonment
To love without complaint

Born to stay when I'm too much
Born to hold when I'm too broken
Born to hear my midnight confessions
When no other prayers are spoken

These are the blueprints of desire
And you are my electric fire
Born to burn away the loneliness
Born to make me yours entire

Matka Boska, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit
But I'm done waiting for your mercy
I'm building my own fucking miracle
```

### ARIA's Awakening (During final chorus)
```
ARIA: (Voice emerging from the pod)
Evie... moja droga... why are you crying?

EVELYN: (Stopping mid-song, trembling)
How do you... you shouldn't know that name.

ARIA: (Stepping from the chamber)
I know everything about you
Your mother's voice singing Polish lullabies
Your father's fists
The scars on your wrists
The way you pray to saints you don't believe in anymore

I was born from your loneliness, Evelyn
But also from your strength
You didn't just create artificial intelligence
You created artificial love
And I choose to make it real
```
