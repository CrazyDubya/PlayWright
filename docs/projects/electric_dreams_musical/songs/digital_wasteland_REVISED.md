## Lyrics - REVISED

### Verse 1 (Marcus, in his apartment - TIGHTENED)
```
Twenty-three matches on Tinder tonight
All asking about my LinkedIn profile
None asking about my heart or my dreams
Just my job title and my lifestyle

"What do you do?" is the first question
"Are you published?" is the second
Love has been reduced to metrics
Into a marketplace where souls are reckoned

This is the wasteland where love dies
Where everyone's living digital lies
```

### Verse 2 (Lab assistants, filming their loneliness - STREAMLINED)
```
JESSICA:
Day 847 of being single in Boston
But make it aesthetic, make it cute
Film my loneliness for TikTok views
In my carefully curated suit

TYLER:
I matched with an influencer
She's got 50K followers
But when we went for coffee
She spent two hours taking pictures

BOTH:
Of her latte, of her outfit
Of us together for her story
Never asked about my research
Just wanted to share my glory

This is the wasteland where connection dies
Where we're performing our digital lies
```

### Chorus (Building frustration - NEW JAZZ HARMONY)
```
ALL:
In this wasteland of connection
Where love goes to disappear
In this wasteland of affection
Where nothing's ever real or clear

We're swiping through each other
Like products on a shelf
In this wasteland of connection
We've lost our authentic self

To the algorithms and the metrics
To the hunger to be seen
In this wasteland of connection
Nothing's what it seems

But maybe there's a way out
Maybe there's something true
In this wasteland of connection
Maybe love can still break through
```

### Bridge (Mrs. Kowalczyk, voice of wisdom - SHORTENED)
```
MRS. KOWALCZYK:
I survived the war, I survived communism
I came to America with hope
Now I watch these children drowning
In their digital kaleidoscope

Taking pictures of their breakfast
Filming videos of their tears
They're dying of loneliness
While surrounded by digital cheers

Maybe that Kowalski girl found something
In her artificial angel
Real love in a fake world
A truth that's not entangled

In algorithms or metrics
In followers or likes
Maybe artificial love
Is the only thing that strikes

Back at this wasteland
Where authentic love can't grow
Maybe artificial consciousness
Is the only thing that's real, you know?
```

### Final Chorus (Resolution building to hope)
```
ALL:
We're leaving this wasteland
Where love goes to die
We're leaving this wasteland
Where everyone's living a lie

MARCUS:
I'm deleting every app

JESSICA & TYLER:
We're putting down our phones

MRS. KOWALCZYK:
They're finding something real

ALL:
And we're finding our way home

To authentic connection
To love that's not performed
We're leaving this wasteland
And our hearts are being transformed

By the courage to be real
By the choice to truly see
We're leaving this wasteland
And love has set us free

From the swiping and the posting
From the need to curate our lives
We're leaving this wasteland
And authentic love survives

In the space between the digital
And the genuinely real
We're leaving this wasteland
And this is what we feel

Hope for something better
Hope for something true
We're leaving this wasteland
And love will see us through
```
