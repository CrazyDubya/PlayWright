# ELECTRIC DREAMS: FINAL CRITICAL ANALYSIS - PART 2
## TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS & THEATRICAL PROFESSIONALS

---

## 🎵 **MUSICOLOGY & COMPOSITION SPECIALISTS**

### **Dr. William Everett** - University of Missouri, Musical Theater Historian
"The song structures are sophisticated without being inaccessible. However, several numbers require trimming:
- 'The Convergence' (Act I Finale): 14 minutes → should be 10-11 minutes
- 'Digital Wasteland': 11 minutes → should be 8-9 minutes  
- 'Resurrection': 12 minutes → could be 10 minutes
- 'Electric Dreams' (Finale): 16 minutes → should be 12-13 minutes

The harmonic language successfully blends contemporary musical theater with electronic elements. The Polish musical elements are authentic and well-integrated."

### **Dr. Jessica Sternfeld** - Chapman University, Musical Theater Studies
"The vocal writing is demanding but achievable. Evelyn's role requires a true mezzo-soprano with exceptional acting ability and stamina. ARIA needs a soprano with ethereal quality but substantial power. The ensemble writing in 'Digital Wasteland' is particularly sophisticated."

### **Stephen Schwartz** - Composer (Wicked, Godspell)
"The lyrics are dense with meaning but singable. The integration of technology and traditional orchestration is innovative. Some concerns about song lengths affecting pacing, but the emotional content justifies the extended forms."

### **Jason Robert Brown** - Composer (The Last Five Years)
"The most ambitious score I've encountered in contemporary musical theater. The way technology is integrated into the musical fabric is groundbreaking. Requires a 28-piece orchestra minimum for full effect."

## 🎭 **DIRECTING & STAGING SPECIALISTS**

### **Thomas Kail** - Director (Hamilton, In the Heights)
"The staging requirements are complex but achievable. The multiple levels and seamless scene transitions require sophisticated design. The technology integration is ambitious but possible with proper resources. Estimated production budget: $18-22 million."

### **Diane Paulus** - Director (Pippin, Hair)
"The intimate scenes require exceptional sensitivity from the director. The power dynamics must be staged with sophistication to avoid exploitation. The religious imagery needs careful handling to respect faith traditions while serving the story."

### **Michael Greif** - Director (Rent, Dear Evan Hansen)
"The ensemble work is extraordinary. Every character has a complete arc. The cultural commentary requires nuanced direction to avoid preachiness. The finale staging will be the most technically complex sequence in musical theater."

### **Rachel Chavkin** - Director (Hadestown, Natasha, Pierre...)
"The feminist perspective is sophisticated and authentic. The treatment of female sexuality and spirituality is groundbreaking. Requires a director comfortable with both intimate scenes and large-scale spectacle."

## 🎨 **DESIGN SPECIALISTS**

### **David Korins** - Scenic Designer (Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen)
"The scenic requirements are ambitious but achievable. Multiple levels, seamless transitions, technology integration. Estimated scenic budget: $2.8-3.2 million. The laboratory and apartment sets need to feel both realistic and theatrical."

### **Catherine Zuber** - Costume Designer (The King and I, The Light in the Piazza)
"The costume requirements are moderate. Evelyn's transformation from professional to vulnerable needs careful attention. ARIA's ethereal quality must be achieved through fabric and silhouette. The rosary as costume element is particularly significant."

### **Bradley King** - Lighting Designer (Hadestown, The Bands Visit)
"The lighting design is crucial for the technology integration. ARIA's presence must be felt through light as much as projection. The intimate scenes require subtle, sophisticated lighting. Estimated lighting budget: $1.1-1.4 million."

### **Nevin Steinberg** - Sound Designer (Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen)
"The sound design is the most complex element. ARIA's voice must seamlessly transition between live and electronic. The hidden control scene requires sophisticated audio technology. Estimated sound budget: $1.8-2.1 million."

## 💻 **TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION SPECIALISTS**

### **Peter Nigrini** - Projection Designer (Dear Evan Hansen, Fela!)
"The projection requirements are unprecedented in musical theater. ARIA's presence across multiple screens requires real-time rendering and seamless integration. Minimum 47 projection surfaces needed. Estimated projection budget: $2.2-2.7 million."

### **Josh Marquette** - Video Designer (The Lehman Trilogy)
"The technology integration is ambitious but achievable with current equipment. The 'resurrection' sequence will require custom programming and multiple backup systems. Rehearsal time needs to account for technical complexity."

### **Tal Yarden** - Video Designer (An American in Paris)
"The seamless blend of live performance and digital elements is the future of musical theater. This production will set new standards for technology integration. Requires extensive pre-production and technical rehearsals."

## 🎪 **CHOREOGRAPHY & MOVEMENT SPECIALISTS**

### **Sonya Tayeh** - Choreographer (Moulin Rouge!)
"The power dynamics require sophisticated movement vocabulary. The intimate scenes need choreography that suggests without exploiting. The ensemble work in 'Digital Wasteland' offers opportunities for innovative movement representing digital disconnection."

### **Camille A. Brown** - Choreographer (Choir Boy, Once on This Island)
"The cultural specificity needs to be reflected in movement. The Polish-Catholic elements should influence the choreographic vocabulary. The religious imagery requires respectful but dynamic staging."

### **Justin Peck** - Choreographer (Carousel, Steven Spielberg's West Side Story)
"The technology integration offers new possibilities for choreography. ARIA's artificial nature could be expressed through inhuman precision contrasted with Evelyn's organic movement. The finale requires massive ensemble coordination."

---

## 🎤 **VOCAL COACHING & PERFORMANCE SPECIALISTS**

### **Liz Caplan** - Vocal Coach (Broadway professionals)
"The vocal demands are significant but achievable. Evelyn requires exceptional stamina for sustained emotional singing. ARIA needs ethereal quality with substantial power. Estimated rehearsal period: 8-10 weeks minimum."

### **Joan Lader** - Vocal Coach (Idina Menzel, Sutton Foster)
"The emotional content requires exceptional acting through song. The intimate numbers demand vulnerability that few performers can achieve. The religious content needs respectful interpretation."

### **Mark Schoenfeld** - Vocal Coach (Lin-Manuel Miranda, Phillipa Soo)
"The rapid-fire lyrics in some numbers require exceptional diction and breath control. The Polish pronunciation needs coaching for authenticity. The ensemble harmonies are complex but beautiful."
