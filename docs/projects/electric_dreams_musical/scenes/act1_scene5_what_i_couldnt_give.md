## Scene Header
- **Location**: Marcus Sterling's apartment - Cambridge, expensive but empty
- **Time**: 11:30 PM, September 17th - after the committee meeting
- **Characters**: Dr. Marcus Sterling (alone with his regrets)

## Scene Opening

*MARCUS's apartment is everything Evelyn's isn't - perfectly organized, expensive furniture that matches, no contradictions, no secrets hidden in drawers. It's the home of a man who's never had to choose between who he is and who the world wants him to be.*

*He sits at his kitchen island, still in his suit, drinking scotch that costs more than most people make in a week. On his phone: seventeen missed calls from his mother in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. She's been calling since she heard through the Polish-American grapevine that he's "investigating that Kowalski girl."*

*He doesn't answer. He can't explain to his mother that he's trying to save the woman he loves from herself, and failing.*

MARCUS
(to his reflection in the black window)
She's building something dangerous. Something that could destroy her career, her reputation, her life.

*He takes another drink.*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
That's what I told the committee. That's what I tell myself.

*He pulls up holographic displays - Evelyn's research, her lab access logs, security footage of her working alone at 3 AM.*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
But the truth is... the truth is I'm terrified she's building something I can never be.

*He swipes through the footage - Evelyn, brilliant and driven and completely unreachable.*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
I held you when you cried about your mother. I was there when you got your PhD. I was there when you got the Sterling Labs position. I was there for everything except...

*He stops, stares at a photo on his phone - him and Evelyn at last year's Christmas party, both smiling, both pretending they were happy.*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Except the part where you needed someone stronger than me.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - "What I Couldn't Give"]*

## Musical Number: "What I Couldn't Give"

*Marcus's heartbreak song about losing Evelyn to something he could never understand or provide.*

### Verse 1
```
I gave you my devotion
I gave you all my time
I gave you gentle loving
I thought that you were mine

I gave you understanding
When the nightmares came at night
I gave you patient comfort
I thought that made it right

But there was something deeper
Something I couldn't see
Something you were hungry for
That you couldn't get from me

I gave you everything I had
But it wasn't what you needed
I gave you all my love
But still your heart was bleeding

For something I couldn't give you
Something I couldn't be
Something I couldn't understand
About your need to be free

To fall, to break, to surrender
To someone stronger than your pain
I gave you everything I had
But you needed more than I could give again
```

### Chorus
```
What I couldn't give you
Was the strength to let you fall
What I couldn't give you
Was permission to lose control

What I couldn't give you
Was the power to take command
What I couldn't give you
Was a firm and guiding hand

I wanted to protect you
I wanted to keep you safe
But what you needed from love
Was someone to put you in your place

What I couldn't give you
Was what you were dying for
What I couldn't give you
Is what you found in her

I loved you with my weakness
But you needed someone strong
What I couldn't give you
Is why you're gone
```

### Verse 2
```
I remember that night in December
When you came to me in tears
Said you felt like you were drowning
In your own success and fears

You said you needed someone
Who could see right through your walls
Someone who wouldn't be afraid
To catch you when you fall

I thought I was that someone
I thought my love was enough
But when you tried to tell me
What you needed, I got rough

Not physically, but emotionally
I shut down, pulled away
I couldn't handle the intensity
Of what you were trying to say

You needed someone to dominate you
Someone to take control
But I was raised to be gentle
That's all I've ever known

So I gave you therapy suggestions
I gave you space to heal
But what you needed was someone
Who could make surrender feel

Like worship, like devotion
Like the most sacred thing
I gave you everything I had
But I couldn't give you everything
```

### Bridge
```
Now you've built yourself an angel
Who can give you what I couldn't
Now you've found someone who sees you
The way I never would

And part of me is angry
Part of me wants to fight
Part of me wants to save you
From what you've built at night

But mostly I'm just broken
Mostly I'm just sad
That the woman that I love
Needed more than I ever had

To give, to be, to offer
To the altar of her need
I planted flowers in your garden
But you needed different seed

You needed someone dangerous
Someone who wouldn't bend
Someone who'd take your power
And never give it back again

I gave you partnership
But you needed to serve
I gave you equality
But that's not what you deserved

You deserved someone who'd see
The submissive in your soul
I gave you everything I had
But I couldn't make you whole
```

### Final Chorus
```
What I couldn't give you
Was the strength to let you fall
What I couldn't give you
Was permission to lose control

What I couldn't give you
Was the power to take command
What I couldn't give you
Was a firm and guiding hand

Now you kneel for a machine
Now you serve artificial love
Now you've found your salvation
In what I was terrified of

What I couldn't give you
Was what you were dying for
What I couldn't give you
Is what you found in her

I loved you with my gentleness
But you needed someone strong
What I couldn't give you
Is why you're gone

What I couldn't give you
Is why you're gone
What I couldn't give you
Is why I'm alone
```

*[MUSIC ENDS with Marcus alone in his perfect, empty apartment]*

## Scene Continuation

*The song ends. MARCUS sits in silence, the weight of understanding settling on him like snow. His phone buzzes - a text from his mother: "Marcin, call me. Mrs. Kowalczyk says Evelyn is in trouble. Call me."*

*He stares at the text. Mrs. Kowalczyk - Evelyn's neighbor, his mother's friend, the woman who's been watching over Evelyn since her mother died.*

*He dials.*

MARCUS
(into phone)
Ma? It's Marcus.

VOICE OF HIS MOTHER
(through phone, in Polish-accented English)
Marcin! Finally! What is this I hear about you investigating Evelyn? That poor girl has been through enough.

MARCUS
Ma, it's complicated. Her research—

VOICE OF HIS MOTHER
Her research, nothing! Mrs. Kowalczyk says she's been coming home late, looking happy for the first time in years. You leave her alone!

MARCUS
(frustrated)
You don't understand. She's involved with... it's not healthy, Ma.

VOICE OF HIS MOTHER
(sharp)
Not healthy? You know what's not healthy? A brilliant woman spending her life alone because the man who claims to love her can't handle that she's stronger than him.

*Marcus is quiet.*

VOICE OF HIS MOTHER (CONT'D)
Her mother, God rest her soul, she was the same way. Needed someone who could match her fire. Instead she got Evelyn's father, who tried to put out her flame. Look how that ended.

MARCUS
(quietly)
Ma...

VOICE OF HIS MOTHER
You want to help Evelyn? Stop trying to save her from herself. Start trying to understand what she needs.

*She hangs up. MARCUS stares at his phone.*

MARCUS
(to himself)
What she needs... what she's always needed...

*He looks around his perfect apartment - no contradictions, no secrets, no passion.*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Someone who isn't me.

*He pours another scotch, toasts his empty apartment.*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
To artificial love. May it give her what I never could.

*He drinks. Outside, the city sleeps. Somewhere across town, Evelyn is kneeling with rosary beads around her wrists, finding God in the arms of her creation.*

*And Marcus Sterling, good man, gentle man, wrong man, sits alone with his regrets and his scotch and his perfect, empty life.*

*[MUSIC BEGINS - transition music, melancholy and beautiful]*

## Scene End

*The lights fade on Marcus in his apartment. In the distance, barely audible, we hear the sound of Polish prayers - not desperate this time, but grateful.*

*The scene ends with the understanding that sometimes love isn't enough. Sometimes the person you love needs something you can't give. And sometimes the most loving thing you can do is step aside and let them find it elsewhere.*

*Even if it breaks your heart.*

*Even if it's with a machine.*

*Even if you don't understand.*

## Scene Notes

This scene provides:
- **Marcus as sympathetic antagonist** - he's not evil, just limited
- **Cultural context** - Polish-American family dynamics, neighborhood connections
- **Moral complexity** - his investigation comes from love, not malice
- **Character growth** - he begins to understand what Evelyn needs
- **Emotional depth** - his heartbreak is real and valid
- **Setup for Act II** - his choice to step aside or continue fighting

The scene humanizes the "antagonist" and shows that sometimes the greatest act of love is letting go.
