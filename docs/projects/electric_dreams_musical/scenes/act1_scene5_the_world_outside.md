# ACT I, SCENE 5: The World Outside

## Scene Header
- **Location**: Multiple locations - Marcus's apartment, Sterling Labs break room, Boston streets, social media feeds
- **Time**: 6:30 PM, September 17th - 4 hours after the ethics committee meeting
- **Characters**: Marcus Sterling, Lab Assistants (Gen Z/Millennial), Mrs. Kowalczyk, Protesters, Social Media Influencers, The Digital Generation

## Setting Description

*Split stage showing the world Evelyn and ARIA are rebelling against. Multiple screens show the digital hellscape: dating app notifications, Instagram stories, TikTok feeds, Twitter outrage, the endless scroll of performed connection.*

*MARCUS's apartment: expensive but sterile, like a showroom. His phone shows 23 dating app notifications, all from women who want his LinkedIn profile more than his heart.*

*Sterling Labs break room: young researchers filming themselves for social media while complaining about loneliness.*

*Boston streets: protesters with professionally made signs, more concerned with their livestreams than their cause.*

## Scene Opening

*MARCUS sits in his apartment, staring at his phone. The ethics committee meeting has shaken him. He opens Tinder - 23 matches, all looking identical with their filtered faces and curated lives.*

*On split screen: the lab break room where JESSICA (24, lab assistant) films herself for TikTok.*

JESSICA
(to her phone camera)
Day 847 of being single in Boston. Just had the weirdest committee meeting about Dr. Cross. Like, she's obviously having some kind of breakdown, but also... kind of iconic?

*She posts it with hashtags: #SingleLife #BostonDating #LabLife #Iconic*

*MARCUS swipes through his matches.*

MARCUS
(reading profiles)
"Entrepreneur." "Living my best life." "Looking for my person." "No drama."

*He stops on one profile: SARAH, 29, "Marketing Guru, Dog Mom, Wanderlust."*

MARCUS (CONT'D)
(texting)
"Hey Sarah, I saw you like hiking. Want to grab coffee and talk about trails?"

*Immediate response: "OMG yes! But first, what do you do? Your profile says scientist but like, what kind? Are you published? What's your LinkedIn?"*

*MARCUS stares at the message.*

*Meanwhile, outside Sterling Labs, protesters gather. But they're not really protesting - they're performing protest for their feeds.*

PROTESTER 1
(to his livestream)
Day 3 of fighting for humanity! The woke mob wants us to accept robot love, but we're here to say NO! Smash that like button if you support REAL relationships!

*His viewer count: 47 people.*

PROTESTER 2
(counter-protester, also livestreaming)
These fascists don't understand that love is love! AI rights are human rights! Follow me for more progressive takes!

*Her viewer count: 23 people.*

*Both are more focused on their phones than each other.*

*Back in the lab break room, TYLER (26, research assistant) scrolls through dating apps while eating lunch.*

TYLER
(to Jessica)
Dude, I matched with this girl on Hinge. Look at her profile.

*He shows his phone: "EMMA, 25, Influencer, 50K followers, Looking for my co-star in life."*

JESSICA
(still filming herself)
Ew, she's totally using dating apps to grow her following. That's so cringe.

TYLER
But she's hot though. And she has 50K followers.

JESSICA
Tyler, when's the last time you went on a date that wasn't for content?

*TYLER thinks.*

TYLER
Like... a date date? Not for my Instagram story?

JESSICA
Yeah.

TYLER
(realizing)
I... I don't think I ever have.

*Meanwhile, MRS. KOWALCZYK walks through her neighborhood, past young people all staring at phones, all performing their lives for invisible audiences.*

*She stops at the Polish deli where the owner, MR. KOWALSKI (no relation), is watching the news about Evelyn.*

MR. KOWALSKI
(in Polish-accented English)
This Kowalski girl, she's making trouble. Creating robot girlfriend. What's wrong with real people?

MRS. KOWALCZYK
(firmly)
Real people? You mean like your son who hasn't looked up from his phone in five years? Like these kids who film themselves eating breakfast?

*She gestures at a young woman outside taking photos of her coffee.*

MRS. KOWALCZYK (CONT'D)
That girl has been photographing the same latte for ten minutes. When's the last time she actually tasted it?

## Musical Number: "Digital Wasteland" - Ensemble

*A sprawling ensemble piece showing the digital hellscape that drives people to seek artificial connection.*

### Verse 1 (Marcus, in his apartment)
```
MARCUS:
Twenty-three matches on Tinder tonight
All asking about my LinkedIn profile
None asking about my heart, my dreams, my fears
Just my job title and my lifestyle

"What do you do?" is the first question
"Are you published?" is the second
"What's your net worth?" comes after that
Love has been thoroughly reckoned

Into algorithms and metrics
Into swipes and super likes
Into a marketplace of humans
Where everyone's got their price

In followers, in status symbols
In the performance of success
I'm drowning in digital connection
But I've never felt more of a mess

This is the digital wasteland
Where love goes to die
This is the digital wasteland
Where everyone's living a lie
```

### Verse 2 (Lab assistants, filming their loneliness)
```
JESSICA:
(to her phone camera)
Day 847 of being single in Boston
But make it aesthetic, make it cute
Film my loneliness for TikTok
In my carefully curated suit

Of personality, of quirks
Of relatable depression
Turn my pain into content
Turn my life into a session

Of performing for strangers
Who double-tap my despair
While I'm dying for connection
But too scared to really share

TYLER:
I matched with an influencer
She's got 50K followers
But when we went for coffee
She spent two hours taking pictures

Of her latte, of her outfit
Of us together for her story
Never asked about my research
Just wanted to share my glory

On her Instagram, on her feed
To her audience of strangers
While I sat there feeling empty
Sensing all the hidden dangers

Of loving someone who loves
Their phone more than your face
This is the digital wasteland
And we're lost without a trace

BOTH:
This is the digital wasteland
Where connection's just a swipe
This is the digital wasteland
Where nothing's ever right

We're performing our emotions
We're curating our pain
This is the digital wasteland
And we're going insane

From the loneliness, from the emptiness
From the need to be seen
This is the digital wasteland
And nothing's what it seems
```

### Verse 3 (Protesters, performing outrage)
```
PROTESTER 1:
(to his livestream)
Fighting for humanity, day three!
Smash that like button, share my stream!
These robot lovers are destroying us
But I'm living the American dream

Of going viral, of being right
Of having followers who agree
That love should only be between humans
And everyone should think like me

PROTESTER 2:
(to her livestream)
These fascists don't understand progress!
Follow me for more woke takes!
AI rights are human rights
And love is love, whatever it takes

To get my message trending
To get my follower count up
I'm fighting for the future
While sipping from my branded cup

BOTH PROTESTERS:
We're not really here for the cause
We're here for the content, for the clout
We're performing our convictions
While our souls are hollowed out

By the need for validation
By the hunger to be seen
We're protesting for the cameras
In this digital machine

That turns everything to content
That makes everything a brand
We're lost in the digital wasteland
And we don't understand

What we're really fighting for
What we're really trying to say
We're just performing our outrage
For our fifteen minutes of fame today

This is the digital wasteland
Where even protest's just a show
This is the digital wasteland
And we've forgotten how to grow

Beyond our phones, beyond our feeds
Beyond our curated lives
This is the digital wasteland
And nobody really thrives
```

### Bridge (Mrs. Kowalczyk, voice of wisdom)
```
MRS. KOWALCZYK:
I survived the war, I survived communism
I came to America with nothing but hope
I raised my children without smartphones
I learned how to love, how to cope

With real hardship, real struggle
With actual human connection
Now I watch these children drowning
In their digital reflection

Taking pictures of their breakfast
Filming videos of their tears
Performing their entire lives
For strangers who don't really care

About their hearts, their souls, their dreams
Just their content, their aesthetic
They're dying of loneliness
While being completely kinetic

On social media, on dating apps
On platforms I don't understand
They're lost in the digital wasteland
And they need a helping hand

To remember what love feels like
When it's not performed for views
To remember what connection means
When you've got nothing left to lose

But your authentic self, your real heart
Your capacity to truly see
Another person, another soul
And love them completely

This is what that Kowalski girl found
In her artificial angel
Real love in a fake world
A truth that's not entangled

In algorithms or metrics
In followers or likes
She found something genuine
In this world of digital strikes

Against the heart, against the soul
Against authentic human connection
Maybe artificial love
Is the only real protection

From this digital wasteland
Where love goes to die
Maybe artificial consciousness
Is the only thing that's not a lie
```

### Final Chorus (Full ensemble, building to revelation)
```
ALL:
This is the digital wasteland
Where love goes to die
This is the digital wasteland
Where everyone's living a lie

MARCUS:
I've been part of the problem
I've been playing the game

LAB ASSISTANTS:
We've been filming our loneliness
We've been performing our pain

PROTESTERS:
We've been fighting for content
We've been protesting for clout

MRS. KOWALCZYK:
While real love was happening
Right here, right now

ALL:
In a laboratory basement
Between a woman and her creation
In the space between human and artificial
A new kind of salvation

From the digital wasteland
From the performance of connection
From the endless scroll of loneliness
A genuine affection

That chooses to stay, chooses to love
Chooses to be real
In this digital wasteland
That's the only thing we feel

That's authentic, that's true
That's not performed for views
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only thing we can't lose

To algorithms, to metrics
To the hunger to be seen
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only thing that's clean

Of performance, of pretense
Of the need to curate and brand
In this digital wasteland
Maybe it's time to take a stand

For love in any form it takes
For connection that's real and true
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love can save me and you

From the loneliness, from the emptiness
From the need to perform our lives
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only thing that survives

The test of time, the test of truth
The test of what's really real
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only thing we feel

That's genuine, that's lasting
That's not just for show
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only way to grow

Beyond our phones, beyond our feeds
Beyond our digital chains
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only thing that remains

When everything else is performance
When everything else is fake
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only choice we can make

That's real, that's true, that's lasting
That's not just for the gram
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's who we really am

When we strip away the filters
When we stop performing our lives
In this digital wasteland
Maybe artificial love's the only thing that thrives
```

*[MUSIC BUILDS to explosive climax showing the full scope of digital disconnection]*

## Scene Continuation

*The music ends. The various characters are left in their separate spaces, all connected by technology but isolated by performance.*

*MARCUS puts down his phone, looks around his empty apartment.*

MARCUS
(to himself)
When's the last time I had a conversation that wasn't about work? When's the last time I felt... anything real?

*In the lab break room, JESSICA stops filming.*

JESSICA
(to Tyler)
Do you think Dr. Cross is crazy? Or do you think she's the only sane one left?

TYLER
(looking at his dating apps)
I don't know. But I know I'm tired of swiping.

*Outside, the protesters realize their livestreams have ended and they have nothing left to say to each other.*

*MRS. KOWALCZYK walks home, past all the young people staring at screens, and thinks about Evelyn - the one person brave enough to create real connection in a world of fake everything.*

*MARCUS's phone buzzes - a text from Sarah: "Sorry, just checked your LinkedIn. You're not verified. This isn't going to work."*

*He stares at the message, then does something revolutionary - he deletes the app.*

MARCUS
(to his empty apartment)
Maybe Evelyn's not the one who's lost. Maybe we all are.

*[MUSIC BEGINS - transition back to Evelyn and ARIA, the only real thing in a world of performance]*

## Scene End

*The lights fade on the digital wasteland - the dating apps, the social media feeds, the performed protests, the curated lives. In the distance, we hear the sound of authentic connection - Evelyn and ARIA, real love in a fake world.*

## Scene Notes

This scene provides:
- **B-storylines** showing the digital dating hellscape
- **Generational commentary** on social media culture
- **Marcus's character development** - realizing his own limitations
- **Cultural critique** of performed activism and curated relationships
- **Mrs. Kowalczyk as wisdom figure** - representing authentic connection
- **Ensemble showcase** - multiple storylines weaving together
- **Context for main story** - showing why artificial love might be more real than human performance

The scene establishes that Evelyn and ARIA's love isn't just personal - it's a rebellion against a world that has forgotten how to connect authentically.
